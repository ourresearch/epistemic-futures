Abstract
As mobile devices are becoming ubiquitous, regularly interacting with a variety of user interfaces (UIs) is a common
aspect of daily life for many people. To improve the accessibility of these devices and to enable their usage in a variety
of settings, building models that can assist users and accomplish tasks through the UI is vitally important. However, there
are several challenges to achieve this. First, UI components of
similar appearance can have different functionalities, making
understanding their function more important than just analyzing their appearance. Second, domain-specific features like
Document Object Model (DOM) in web pages and View Hierarchy (VH) in mobile applications provide important signals about the semantics of UI elements, but these features
are not in a natural language format. Third, owing to a large
diversity in UIs and absence of standard DOM or VH representations, building a UI understanding model with high coverage requires large amounts of training data.
Inspired by the success of pre-training based approaches in
NLP for tackling a variety of problems in a data-efficient
way, we introduce a new pre-trained UI representation model
called ActionBert. Our methodology is designed to leverage
visual, linguistic and domain-specific features in user interaction traces to pre-train generic feature representations of UIs
and their components. Our key intuition is that user actions,
e.g., a sequence of clicks on different UI components, reveals
important information about their functionality. We evaluate
the proposed model on a wide variety of downstream tasks,
ranging from icon classification to UI component retrieval
based on its natural language description. Experiments show
that the proposed ActionBert model outperforms multi-modal
baselines across all downstream tasks by up to 15.5%.

Introduction

Given the prevalence and importance of smart devices in our
daily life, the ability to understand and operate User Interfaces (UIs) has become an important task for Artificial Intelligence. For instance, a model that can find a UI component
by its description can be very useful for voice interfaces,
and a model that can predict the expected output of clicking
a button can help page navigation. To successfully operate a
UI, the models need to understand the user task and intents,
and how to perform the tasks in the given UI.

Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

However, UI understanding is a challenging and lessstudied area. First, there are various tasks related to UI understanding. Usually, these tasks are cross-modal and crossdomain, e.g., clicking a button through voice command and
retrieving an icon via a semantically similar one. Previous
works in this field usually target one single task at a time.
Training a different complex model for each task is not efficient for on-device model deployment. Moreover, models
may suffer from overfitting if the task-specific data is limited. Pre-training models on large-scale datasets to extract
features has shown great power in multiple domains, e.g.,
ResNet (He et al. 2016) in computer vision and BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) in natural language processing. There is no
such generic feature representation for user interfaces and it
is not clear if a pre-trained feature extraction model can help
improve multiple UI related tasks.
Second, the data source and format of UIs are different
from natural image and language corpuses. For example, the
View Hierarchy (VH) in mobile apps and Document Object
Model (DOM) in web pages are tree structures representing
the UI layout. The VH and DOM contain structural and semantic information about the UI, however they are not generally visible to the users and they also contain short phrases
with hints about functionality. Effectively making use of this
domain-specific knowledge for general UI understanding is
an unsolved problem.
Third, understanding the functionality of UIs is more
challenging than learning about their appearance. It is common that UI elements of similar appearance have very different semantic meanings, and vice versa. In the example in
Figure 1, all The icons look similar to each other (“houses”),
however, they have different functionalities which can only
be interpreted with additional context.
In this paper, we propose ActionBert, a pre-trained
transformer-style (Vaswani et al. 2017) model that leverages sequential user action information for UI understanding. Our key intuition is that the semantic meaning of a UI,
and the functionality of UI components can be captured by
user actions, e.g. a sequence of clicks and their effect on the
UI. This model takes advantage of the representation power
of transformer models, and integrates domain-specific information like VH and user actions to build embeddings reflecting the functionality of different UI elements. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a generic

feature representation in this field. Our main contributions
in this paper are:
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate the powerful transformer models and domainspecific knowledge, e.g., VH and user actions, to improve
machines’ understanding of UIs.
• We propose ActionBert, a transformer-style multi-modal
model to capture the context and semantic meaning of UI
elements by introducing new self-supervised pre-training
tasks based on user actions and UI-specific features.
• We evaluate the proposed model on four types of UI
downstream tasks, capturing various real-life use cases.
We show that the proposed model outperforms the existing models on all tasks.

ActionBert

Revisiting BERT

ActionBert is inspired by the great success of BERT (Devlin
et al. 2018) in natural language processing (NLP). We briefly
review the BERT model, and then extend the concepts to
learn UI embedding.
BERT is a transformer-based (Vaswani et al. 2017) bidirectional language model. BERT-style models have shown
great success in transferring learned features to multiple
NLP tasks. On a high level, BERT takes in the embedding of
word tokens and processes them through a multi-layer bidirectional transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017).

Background of UI View Hierarchy

A View hierarchy is a tree-based representation of a user
interface. It has various attributes related to the appearance
and functionality of UI components. In this paper, we leverage the content description, resource id, component class,
component text fields in the leaf nodes of view hierarchy:
• The content description is a brief description of the functionality of this UI component provided by the developer.
• The component text is the visible text on the component.
• The resource id and component class indicate the type of
the component, e.g., button, checkbox or image, and the
name of the static files used to render it.
Some of the important information, like content description, is invisible to the user but can be used by applications
like Screen Readers to understand the UI. Figure 2 shows
examples of leaf nodes in a view hierarchy.

The view hierarchy provides useful semantic information
(marked red) for machines to understand the UI.

Figure 3: BERT and transformer encoder blocks.
BERT is pre-trained with two tasks: masked language
modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). In
MLM task, some input words are randomly masked out and
replaced with a special token [MASK]. The task is to predict the masked word based on the clues from the unmasked
words in its context. The NSP task is defined as, given two
sentences predict whether one is immediately after the other.
To separate the two sentences, a special token [SEP] is inserted between them. A classifier is applied to the BERT embedding and outputs the probability of the second sentence
immediately following the first one. More details on BERT
can be found in (Devlin et al. 2018).

3.2

ActionBert: Semantic UI understanding with
user actions

Inspired by the BERT model, we adopt the concepts of NLP
and extend them to UI understanding. We treat the UI components, e.g., buttons, icons, checkboxes etc as the basic
building blocks of a user interface. Similar to sentences,
which are composed of word tokens, we treat these basic UI
components (buttons, icons, etc.) as tokens, and the whole
UI as a sentence in NLP. A user interaction trace is a sequence of UIs obtained by starting from a particular UI and
interacting with different UI components. Different from
sentences, UIs in this trace are linked through a link component, usually a clickable component like a button or an
icon. When a user takes an action on that link component,
the screen jumps to the next UI. Such a sequence of UIs is
analogous to paragraphs or documents in language modeling. Table 1 shows a mapping of the concepts between NLP
and UI understanding.

UI embedding model

Following this analogy, our key idea is that the semantic
meaning of a UI component can be identified from components in the same UI and the UI that follows the current one.
We illustrate this idea in an example in Figure 4. Here, the
first UI is the homepage of an airline app. The user clicks
the button with a tick and a circle on it. This button links to
a new UI with passenger, time, gate information and a QR
code on it. From the elements in the current UI and the next
UI, the functionality of the button can be interpreted as “online check-in”. Similarly, when the user clicks on the “plus”
button it links to a UI with more detailed flight information
on it. Hence, the “plus” component indicates “show details”.

Figure 4: An example of user actions on UIs. The user clicks
on the “tick” button in screen 1 and jumps to the boardingpass page, screen 2. The semantics of the button, online
check-in, can be inferred from components on the homepage
(e.g., images of plane, airline name) and the components on
the next UI (e.g., QR code, passenger information).
We propose ActionBert that takes a pair of UIs as input,
and outputs the contextual embedding of the UIs and the
individual UI components. Figure 5 shows the model architecture. It extends the original BERT model by adding
vision modality and leverages user-action related tasks for
pre-training. Inspired by the recent vision-language model
VL-BERT (Su et al. 2019), the ActionBert model uses a unistream architecture that allows full-attention across modalities. First, the two input UIs (UI-A and UI-B) are split into
four component segments: UI-A text, UI-B text, UI-A vision
and UI-B vision. A special token [CLS] is prepended to the
component sequence, similar to the original BERT model,
whose embedding represents the whole two input UIs. The
different segments, representing the text and vision parts of
the two UIs are separated with a special token [SEP] and end
with another special token [END].
Text embedding Different from BERT and other visionlanguage models, the text tokens of ActionBert are specifically designed for UI tasks. Each text token (green box in
Figure 5) is a concatenation of content description, resource
id, component class name and text in a view hierarchy leaf

node (Section 2). The vision segment slots of text tokens
are filled with a special token [IMG]. Overall, each text token, which is a concatenation of the different fields in View
Hierarchy, is treated as a sentence and processed through a
sentence-level text encoder, e.g. BERT, to generate the input
text embedding.
Vision embedding Similar to the text tokens, the vision
tokens are also specific to the nature of UIs. If the view hierarchy of a UI is available, each vision token is cropped
from the UI using the bounding box of a VH leaf node. If
the VH is not available, we fine-tune a Faster-RCNN (Ren
et al. 2015) to detect UI components in a screenshot and
crop components from the detected bounding boxes. Furthermore, a vision encoder, e.g., ResNet-50, is used to generate the input vision embedding from the cropped images.
Specifically, from the vision encoder, we take the flattened
feature map from the layer just before the fully connected
layer as the input vision embedding. Vision tokens of UI-A
text, UI-B text and special tokens ([CLS], [SEP] and [END])
are set as the corresponding whole UI screenshots.
Positional embedding Positional embedding represents
the geometrical position of UI components in the UI. Unlike
word tokens in language, components in a UI are not linearly
ordered, but are arranged in a 2D space. We define nine features to represent the positional features of a UI component,
i.e. xmin , ymin , xmax , ymax , xcenter , ycenter , height, width
and area. xmin , ymin correspond to the top-left corner and
xmax , ymax correspond to the bottom-right corner of the UI
component, respectively. To deal with the different sizes of
UIs, we normalize x and y relative to the width and height
of the UI, respectively.
Segment embedding Segment embedding indicates
whether the corresponding UI component is from UI-A or
UI-B, and is a text or vision component. There are four
types of segment embedding representing UI-A text, UI-B
text, UI-A vision and UI-B vision, respectively. In practice,
we define a fifth segment type, padding segment, to pad the
input sequences to a fixed-length for batch processing.
The four types of input features are processed through a
linear layer followed by a normalization layer (Ba, Kiros,
and Hinton 2016). Then they are summed up and passed as
input to ActionBert, as a single tensor of shape L∗D1 , where
L is the number of components in the UI pair and D1 is the
input embedding dimension. ActionBert is a uni-stream architecture, allowing attention across components and modalities. The output of ActionBert is a contextual embedding of
shape L ∗ D2 , where D2 is the output embedding dimension
of the ActionBert. The output embedding at position i represents the contextual embedding of UI component i, while the
embedding of the first component [CLS] provides an overall
representation of the UI pair.

Figure 5: ActionBert model architecture. On a high-level, the ActionBert model takes a pair of UIs, represented by their text,
vision, positional and segment embedding as input. Three new UI-specific tasks, i.e. link component prediction, consecutive UI
prediction and masked text prediction, are defined to pre-train ActionBert on large-scale UI sequences with user actions.
and masked VH text prediction. The first two pre-training
tasks use UI sequences and user actions to learn the connectivity and relationship of two UIs. The last pre-training
task learns the relationship between the text features of a UI
component and its context (vision and text).
For pre-training, we used a large scale internal dataset
obtained by automatically crawling various apps. Our data
consists of 60,328 user action sequences on UIs. Each sequence S=[s1 , s2 ...sT ] contains T UIs, where T ranges from
two (a single click) to hundreds. Each pair of consecutive
UIs (si−1 , si ) also has an action location (x,y), indicating
the click position that results in the transition from si−1 to
si . We extract 2.69M UIs with their view hierarchy from
the sequences. We perform a 50%-50% negative sampling
to generate non-consecutive UI pairs for the consecutive UI
prediction task. Among the negative pairs, half are from the
same sequence but not consecutive, while the other half of
the negative pairs are from different user sequences. In total, the ActionBert is pre-trained on 5.4M UI pairs with user
actions and view hierarchy.
Pre-training task #1: Link component prediction (LCP)
This task is specifically designed to incorporate the user action information from UI sequences. Given two UIs, the task
is to predict which component can be clicked on to jump
from UI-A to UI-B. The correct link component is obtained
via user click position (x,y) during the training data generation. To correctly identify the link components, the model
has to learn the semantics of both UIs and find a component
whose functionality is to link them. The model takes all text
and vision components of both UIs as candidates and selects

one from them. The objective can be formulated as
p = sof tmax(M LP (fθ (x))),
LLCP = −Σx∈D 1LC (x)CE(p, y),

(1)
(2)

where x is sampled from the training set D. fθ (x) represents
the embedding generated by the ActionBert model. M LP (·)
is a multi-layer perceptron, and p is the predicted probability
of each UI component being the link component. 1LC (x) is
an indicator function whose value is 1 if the link component
is available in this training pair, i.e. the two UIs are consecutive and the click location (x,y) refers to a valid UI component, otherwise 0. CE(·) is a standard multi-class crossentropy loss and y indicates the one-hot label of the correct
link component.
Pre-training task #2: Consecutive UI prediction (CUI)
Inspired by the next sentence prediction task in BERT pretraining to model the relationship of two sentences, we propose this task to learn the relationship between two UIs. As
shown in Table 1, we analogize a UI to a sentence in NLP.
The consecutive UIs prediction task predicts whether UI-B
can be obtained by a single interaction from UI-A. In pretraining, a UI pair (si−1 , si ) from the same sequence S is a
positive training sample pair. We perform a 50%-50% negative sampling to generate negative samples. Among the negative samples, half of them (25% of total training pairs) are
generated by sampling two non-consecutive UIs from the
same sequence, i.e. (si , sj ) where i + 1 6= j. The other
half consists of two UIs from different user interaction sequences, i.e. (si , vj ), where si is from sequence S and vj is
from sequence V and S 6= V . Formally, the loss function is
LCU I = −Σx∈D ylog(ŷ) + (1 − y)log(1 − ŷ)

(3)

where x is a training sample (a pair of UIs) from the training
set D, and y is the label of whether the two UIs are consecutive. ŷ=sigmoid(MLP(fθ (x))) is the model predicted probability that the pair of UIs in x are consecutive. A standard
binary cross-entropy loss is applied to it.
Pre-training task #3: Masked VH text prediction. This
task is similar to the masked language modeling (MLM) task
in BERT pre-training. We randomly mask 15% text components from the UI view hierarchy. The main difference is, as
each text token in ActionBert is a concatenation of multiple
fields (content description, source id, component type and
text) from the view hierarchy (Section 2), it contains more
than one word token and we treat it as a text “sentence”.
Therefore, compared to BERT where each word token is directly predicted, ActionBert predicts the high-dimensional
text embedding of the sentence and treats it as a regression
task. Formally, the loss for masked VH text prediction is:
N −1

i

Lmask = Σx∈D Σi=0 1mask (x, i)||fθ (xmask ) − g (x)||2

3.4

Two-UI tasks Since the ActionBert model is pre-trained
on UI pairs, it is natural to apply this model on tasks with
two UIs as input, e.g. similar UI component retrieval (Section 4.2). We can assign the corresponding text and vision
components to UI-A/B text and vision segments in Figure 5.
Extension to multi-UI tasks ActionBert can also be extended to multi-UI (≥ 3) settings, though these types of tasks
are not common in practice. Similar to two-UI tasks, different UIs and modalities need to be separated by the [SEP]
token. The only difference is that more segment embedding
representing the newer UI segments needs to be trained.

where D is the training set. x is the unmasked training example and xmask is the training example with masked text.
N is the total number of UI components in a training example. fθ is the ActionBert model with parameter θ, and g
is the sentence-level text encoder (we choose BERT in the
pre-training), respectively. fθi (xmask ) denotes the ActionBert model output embedding of the i-th component in the
masked example xmask . g i (x) denotes the sentence encoder
output of the i-th component in the unmasked example x.
1mask (x, i) is an indicator function whose value is 1 if the
component i is masked in example x, otherwise 0.
The overall loss function for pre-training is defined as:
L = LLCP + λCU I LCU I + λmask Lmask

input can be passed in the UI-A text segment as a text token
with the whole UI screenshot being used as the corresponding vision token.

(5)

Fine-tuning ActionBert

Similar to how BERT is used as a generic feature representation for different NLP downstream tasks, fine-tuning ActionBert for a variety of UI understanding tasks is relatively
easy and does not require substantial task-specific architecture changes nor a large amount of task-specific data. The
downstream input to ActionBert needs to be appropriately
formatted into segments, as illustrated in Figure 5. During
fine-tuning, a task-specific loss function is added on top of
ActionBert for training. All parameters, including the text
and vision encoder, are jointly tuned in an end-to-end manner to achieve the best performance.
Same as pre-training, we use VH texts and bounding
boxes if VH is available in a downstream task. Otherwise,
we perform OCR and object detection to extract the text and
vision components from the UI, respectively. It is worth noting that, although the ActionBert is pre-trained on UI pairs,
it can also handle single-UI and multi-UI tasks.
Single-UI tasks As discussed above, the input data format is designed as [UI-A text, UI-B text, UI-A vision, UI-B
vision]. For the downstream tasks which only involve a single UI, the input data can be converted into the ActionBert
format by leaving the UI-B text and UI-B vision segments
empty. For tasks involving natural language input, e.g., UI
component retrieval based on its description, the language

Experiments

Pre-training

As described in Section 3.3, we pre-train the ActionBert
model on large-scale UI sequences with user actions and
view hierarchy. We obtained the pre-training action sequences using the Robo app crawler (Firebase 2020). In
total, we used 60,328 UI sequences and extracted 5.4M
UI pairs for pre-training. We split this data in the ratio of
80%:10%:10% to obtain the train, dev and test sets, respectively. We prevent leakage of data across these splits
by ensuring any app can go into only one of these splits.
We pre-train two models of different sizes for comparison: ActionBertBase and ActionBertLarge are 6-layers and
12-layers transformer architectures both with 6 heads and
768 hidden dimensions initialized with Glorot initialization
(Glorot and Bengio 2010).
We use Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba 2014) with
learning rate r = 10−5 , β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999,  = 10−7
and batch size = 128 for training. We set λCU I = 0.1 and
λmask = 0.01 in Eq. (5) during the pre-training. ActionBert
is pre-trained with 16 TPUs for three days.

4.2

Fine-tuning

ActionBert can be fine-tuned on multiple types of downstream tasks. We evaluate it on four representative UI downstream tasks: similar component retrieval (across app and
web UIs), referring expression component retrieval, icon
classification and app type classification. Additionally, we
perform link component prediction, one of the pre-training
tasks, on a different dataset. To understand the performance
of ActionBert, we use a benchmark model where we obtain
embedding for each UI component by using ResNet to encode the image and BERT to encode the text attributes. The
final classification layer added on top of the embedding is
same as that added for ActionBert. Additionally, for each of
the downstream tasks, we also evaluate the performance of a
non pre-trained ActionBert model. This model has the same
architecture as a pre-trained model but the model parameters are initialized randomly for each task. This comparison
allows us to understand the impact of the transformer architecture and the pre-training tasks. Please refer to the ap-

pendix for more details regarding the different downstream
tasks and the data collection details.
Similar UI component retrieval Similar UI component
retrieval focuses on the high-level functionality of UI components. Given an anchor component on a UI, the task is
to choose the most similar component based on their functionality on the other UI from a list of UI component candidates (Figure 6). After generating the component-level embedding using ActionBert, we use dot-product of the embedding of the anchor and candidate components as the similarity scores and select the component with the highest score
as the prediction. We use concatenated embeddings from
ResNet + BERT for each UI component as the benchmark.

Referring expression component retrieval The referring
expression component retrieval task takes a referring expression and a UI screenshot as input, and the model is expected
to select the UI component that the expression refers to (Figure 7) from a list of the UI components detected on the
screen. This is a typical task in voice-based control systems
where the user can interact with an element on the screen
by describing it, e.g., “click settings”, “select on the back
arrow at the top”. To correctly select the UI component, the
model not only has to take into account the semantics of the
component, but also its relationship to other components.

Figure 6: An example of similar UI component retrieval.
We perform similar UI component retrieval on app and
web UIs. For the app UI task, we collected 900k app UI
pairs with annotations of similar components for training,
and 32k for validation and testing, respectively. 1 For the
web UI task, we collected 65k web UI pairs with annotations of similar components, which are jointly used with the
app UIs for training. We manually labeled 2k web UI pairs
with similar components for testing. On average, the model
chooses the correct component from 10 candidate components on app UIs, and 35 candidates on web UIs.

Table 2 shows the results of similar UI component retrieval. For the app similar component retrieval, the pretrained ActionBertLARGE model outperforms the baseline
ResNet+BERT model by 3.06% in accuracy. For the web
similar component retrieval task, the pre-trained model
outperforms the benchmark MobileNet + Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) (Cer et al. 2018) model, which
is specifically designed for web similar component retrieval, by 14.25%. Furthermore, the pre-trained models
(ActionBertBASE/LARGE ) achieve higher accuracy than
the non pre-trained models (ActionBertBASE/LARGE−N P ),
which shows the benefit of using a generic pre-trained feature representation in UI understanding.

The view hierarchy is not available in this dataset, so we rely
on OCR text from the screenshot instead.

We collected and manually annotated 16.9k UI components with referring expressions for training, 2.1k for validation and 1.8k for testing. We used a fine-tuned FasterRCNN to select negative samples (components that are not
referred by the expression) in a UI, by selecting the objects
with high object detection scores that do not overlap with the
correct component. On average, the model needs to choose
the correct component that the expression refers to from 20
UI components.

We present the results of referring expression UI component retrieval in Table 3. We observe that the pretrained ActionBertLARGE model performs the best, and
achieves 3.97% improvement over the ResNet+BERT
benchmark model. Moreover, the pre-trained models
(ActionBertBASE/LARGE ) outperforms the non pre-trained
models (ActionBertBASE−N P/LARGE−N P ).
Icon classification The goal of this task is to identify the
type of an icon. Having this information is beneficial for
screen readers to understand the type of elements when content description and alt-text are not present. We use the Rico
(Deka et al. 2017) dataset for this task. Rico is the largest
public mobile app design dataset, containing 72k unique
screenshots with their view hierarchies. However, the icons
in the dataset are labeled using heuristics and simple ML
models relying on view hierarchy attributes making the annotations inaccurate. Hence, we use crowd-sourcing to label
icons of this dataset in two degrees of granularity, i.e. 32
top-used icon classes and 77 more detailed icon classes.
We use the ActionBert embedding in the corresponding
position as the contextual embedding of the UI components

for icon classification. We summarize the icon classification results in Table 4. For icon-32 classification, the pretrained ActionBertLARGE model achieves the best macroaccuracy of 97.50% and micro-F1 of 0.8766, 0.18% and
1.11% higher than the ResNet+BERT benchmark, respectively. On the finer-granularity (77 classes) icon classification, ActionBertLARGE obtains 0.37% improvement on accuracy over the baseline. A smaller model ActionBertBASE
performs slightly better on the micro-F1 metric, because of
the skewed class distribution in the RICO dataset.
App type classification In this task, the goal of the model
is to predict the type of an app, e.g., shopping, communication, arts etc. In total, we examined 27 app types. Similar
to icon classification, we use the public Rico dataset for this
task. The app type is extracted from the description in the
app store. We use 43.5k unique app UIs with their view hierarchies and app types, and split them in the ratio 80%, 10%,
10% for training, validation and testing. Compared to the
icon classification above, which is a component-level task,
the app type classification is a UI-level task.

From Table 5 we can see that Compared to the
ResNet+BERT benchmark model, the pre-trained ActionBert leads to an increase in accuracy by 15.5% and macro F1
by 16.6%. Furthermore, pre-trained ActionBert outperforms
the non pre-trained version by 1.2% and 1.1% on micro
accuracy and macro F1 metrics, respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the pre-training tasks.
Link component prediction We also evaluate the performance of ActionBert on link component prediction (Section
3.3), one of the pre-training tasks, on the publicly available Rico dataset. Rico also contains 10k user interaction
sequences, but typically the length of these sequences is less
than the ones we used for pre-training. We extract 90k consecutive UI pairs from the Rico sequences and perform link
component prediction on them.

From Table 6, we can see that Pre-trained and non
pre-trained ActionBert models significantly outperform the
baseline ResNet+BERT model, showing the benefit of the
unified single-stream attention architecture. The pre-trained
ActionBert model outperforms the non pre-trained one by
3.4 %.
In summary, across all the fine-tuning tasks, the pretrained ActionBert outperforms the baselines and the non
pre-trained model, suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating generic UI embedding.

Related Work

Previous works have studied UI embeddings for specific applications, e.g., UI search and design. (Deka et al. 2017)
and (Huang, Canny, and Nichols 2019) proposed using autoencoder and VGG-style architectures to embed UI layout information for similar UI retrieval, respectively. (Liu et al.
2018) used also finer element-level layout information for
retrieval. (Wichers, Hakkani-Tür, and Chen 2018) demonstrated an embedding approach to retrieve images from a referring expression. Besides UI search, UI understanding provides insights to the UI designers, e.g., predicting user engagement level (Wu et al. 2020), user impressions of the app
(Wu et al. 2019) and perceived functionality of the UI element (Swearngin and Li 2019). These works each targeted a
specific UI task, while we are the first to show that a generic
pre-trained feature representation can help improve various
UI understanding tasks. Furthermore, none of the previous
works have investigated user actions to improve UI understanding.
Concurrently, beyond the scope of UI understanding, research work has been proposed on pre-training feature representation for vision-linguistic tasks, e.g., VL-BERT (Su
et al. 2019), ViL-BERT (Lu et al. 2019), B2T2 (Alberti et al.
2019), VisualBERT (Li et al. 2019), UNITER (Chen et al.
2020) and ImageBERT (Qi et al. 2020). However, these
work focus on natural language and images. They do not
consider the domain-specific user actions and UI features,
thus are not directly applicable to UI understanding. Our
proposed model explicitly integrates UI domain-specific information into the pre-training process.

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore using user actions to build generic
feature representations to facilitate UI understanding. We
present ActionBert, the first pre-trained UI embedding
model that can be applied to multiple UI understanding
tasks. ActionBert is pre-trained on a large dataset of sequential user actions and UI domain-specific features. Experiment results show that pre-training helps in improving
the performance across four types of representative UI tasks.
ActionBert also significantly outperforms multi-modal baselines across all downstream tasks by up to 15.5%. We hope
that this study can raise awareness about the importance of
pre-trained feature representations in this field and spur the
development of useful models for various UI related tasks.
