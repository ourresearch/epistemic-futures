Abstract
As automated reasoning systems advance rapidly, there is a growing need
for research-level formal mathematical problems to accurately evaluate their
capabilities. To address this, we present Formal Conjectures,2 an evolving
benchmark of currently 2615 mathematical problem statements formalized
in Lean 4. Sourced from areas of active mathematical research, the dataset
features 1029 open research conjectures providing a zero-contamination
benchmark for mathematical proof discovery, and 836 solved problems for
proof auto-formalization. Notably, the repository provides a structured
interface connecting mathematicians who formalize and clarify problems
with the AI systems and humans attempting to solve them. Demonstrating
its immediate utility, the benchmark has already been leveraged to make
new mathematical discoveries, including the resolution of open research
conjectures. We describe our approach to ensuring the correctness of these
formalizations in a collaborative open-source project where contributions
stem from an active community. In this framework, AI-generated proofs
and disproofs serve as a valuable auditing mechanism to iteratively improve
the fidelity of the benchmark. Finally, we provide a standardized evaluation setup and report baseline results on frozen evaluation subsets, demonstrating a climbable signal that measures the current frontier of automated
reasoning on research-level mathematics.

Introduction

As automated reasoning systems, including large language models (LLMs), continue improving their capabilities, the benchmarks used to measure their progress face significant
challenges. In the domain of (formal) mathematics, many existing evaluation frameworks
suffer from: (i) Data leakage: As solutions to benchmark problems appear online, it is
diﬀicult to distinguish genuine reasoning from memorization. This is a challenge for benchmarks like Zheng et al. [2021], Tsoukalas et al. [2024], Jiang et al. [2025], Yu et al. [2025];
(ii) Secretive evaluation: To combat leakage, some benchmarks require that the evaluation set be kept private, which hinders open and reproducible research [Chollet et al., 2025,
Glazer et al., 2024, Center for AI Safety et al., 2026]; (iii) Oversimplified success criteria: Many benchmarks rely on verifying a simple, machine-checkable final answer (such
as a number), which fails to capture the complex, multi-step reasoning inherent in a full

mathematical proof [Hendrycks et al., 2021, Glazer et al., 2024]; and (iv) Saturation: As
models improve, some benchmarks become saturated. For instance, MiniF2F [Zheng et al.,
2021] is now routinely solved with over 99%; see Hubert et al. [2025], Chen et al. [2025b],
Lin et al. [2025].
To address these limitations, we introduce Formal Conjectures, an open-source and growing collection of mathematical problems formalized in Lean 4 [Moura and Ullrich, 2021] using
Mathlib [The mathlib Community, 2020]. The benchmark focuses on open conjectures as the
primary challenge, providing a zero-contamination testbed where solutions cannot be found
in existing training data. The secondary challenge consists of (informally) solved problems
for auto-formalization, which do not share the same zero-contamination guarantees. We
formalize all problems in a formal language to allow for objective, rigorous, and automated
evaluation: a proposed solution is definitively correct if and only if its corresponding proof
is accepted by the kernel without relying on forbidden axioms like sorry. Our choice of
Lean 4 is pragmatic: Mathlib, the largest formal mathematics library available, is essential
for stating a wide variety of advanced conjectures. While we focus on Lean 4, the core
principles of our benchmark are language-agnostic and extendable to other formal systems.
This paper details the construction and methodology of the Formal Conjectures benchmark. The benchmark is publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license and has already
been utilized for real-world mathematical discovery [Alexeev and Mixon, 2025, DeepMind,
2026]. In summary, our main contributions are:
• The Formal Conjectures Benchmark: A large-scale, evolving dataset of 2615
mathematical statements in Lean 4, including 1029 open conjectures for zerocontamination proof discovery and 836 solved problems for auto-formalization.
• A Unified API for Mathematical Reasoning: A repository interface connecting mathematicians with an ecosystem of automated solvers to facilitate simultaneous statement auditing and rapid dissemination of problems to AI systems.
• Methodology for Statement Formalization: We introduce a collaborative
pipeline and a three-level taxonomy of misformalizations (Translation, Underspecified, and Source) to ensure formalization fidelity. This includes the answer(sorry)
mechanism, which decouples the mathematical value discovery from proof verification. We provide insights from 291 fixed cases of research-level formalization.
• A Standardized Evaluation Framework: We provide a rigorous evaluation
setup using the Lean 4 kernel to verify multi-step reasoning without relying on
oversimplified numerical answers. We establish frozen subsets, FC100SolvedSet1 and
FC100OpenSet1, to enable stable, reproducible model comparisons.

Related Work

Our work intersects mathematical reasoning benchmarks and formal theorem proving.
General mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Several benchmarks evaluate AI systems on advanced problem-solving without requiring formal proofs. FrontierMath [Glazer
et al., 2024] uses expert-crafted problems verified by numerical answers, which, while
machine-checkable, do not fully capture the multi-step reasoning process. In January 2026,
Epoch AI launched FrontierMath: Open Problems, a website-only pilot of a small collection
of unsolved research-level informal problems with evaluation offered as a service. Humanity’s Last Exam [Center for AI Safety et al., 2026] crowdsources expert questions but relies
on answer-checking rather than proof verification. MathArena [Balunović et al., 2025] evaluates LLMs on fresh competition problems to reduce contamination risk and assesses informal
proof-writing. The ARC Prize [Chollet et al., 2025, 2026] targets abstract reasoning, sharing
our focus on measuring genuine reasoning over pattern matching. Formal benchmarks, by
contrast, allow automatic verification of full reasoning or proof.
Formal mathematics benchmarks and automated theorem proving. Interest in
automated theorem proving has accelerated AI reasoning, leading to the rapid saturation
of existing formal benchmarks. MiniF2F [Zheng et al., 2021] pioneered high-school-level

evaluation but became increasingly saturated as models improved. This shift was defined
by AlphaProof [Hubert et al., 2025] and AlphaGeometry 2 [Chervonyi et al., 2025] reaching
silver-medal performance at the 2024 IMO, where AlphaProof solved Lean problems and
introduced the Formal-IMO [Hubert et al., 2025] dataset. Systems like Aristotle [Achim
et al., 2025] and Seed-Prover [Chen et al., 2025b] achieved gold-medal equivalents at the
2025 IMO. This capability leap cascaded to undergraduate math, where benchmarks like
PutnamBench [Tsoukalas et al., 2024] and Putnam 2025 are being saturated by models such
as Seed-Prover 1.5 [Chen et al., 2025a] and Numina [Liu et al., 2026], and other industry
systems. While SorryDB [Letson et al., 2026] evaluates AI on practical theorem completion
and FATE [Jiang et al., 2025] targets varying diﬀiculties of frontier algebra, the saturation
of earlier benchmarks highlights an acute need for research-level evaluation: benchmarking
reasoning on unsolved research-level mathematics.
Adoption of Formal Conjectures. Since its open-source release in May 2025, the repository has been adopted by both mathematicians and tool builders. Boris Alexeev used a
repository formalization to prove Erdős Problem 124 [Bloom, 2025] with Aristotle [Achim
et al., 2025]. Although the statement was initially misformalized and included an unintended
extra hypothesis, Aristotle’s proof succeeded without relying on it. Numerous subsequent
successes such as [Alexeev and Mixon, 2025] highlight the repository’s value for discovery
and demonstrate how AI-generated proofs serve as a vital auditing mechanism to improve
formalization fidelity. A DeepMind prover agent [DeepMind, 2026] conducted a systematic
evaluation of the full repository, solving several open problems. To facilitate standardized,
reproducible evaluation, this paper introduces named, versioned snapshots (Section 4.1),
moving beyond individual tests to systematic benchmarking across diverse methods.

Figure 3: A statement in Formal Conjectures, an open conjecture from [Hartshorne, 1974].
It includes an informal statement as a comment, tags, and a Lean statement.
The collection is divided into two primary categories: Unsolved Conjectures, open research problems where a formal or informal proof would represent a new mathematical
discovery; and Solved Problems, established theorems with known informal proofs that
benchmark an AI’s ability to formalize existing arguments, though only a fraction currently
have a formal proof available. We include both categories not only because they independently serve as benchmarks for different tasks (proof generation and auto-formalization),
but also because they are often intertwined. When formalizing an open conjecture, it is
natural to also state and prove simpler, solved variations. For instance, a general conjecture
about the existence of Hadamard matrices of size 4k for all valid k ∈ N can be presented
alongside the solved cases (e.g., for all k ≤ 166) and the first open case (k = 167).
Other sources of solved problems are collections of conjectures that include both open and
solved questions. In those cases, we also formalize the statements of the solved cases. They
are often related in subject to the open conjectures, and hence the formalization of their
statements and the auto-formalization of their proofs support the open conjectures.
The collection of solved problems also includes simpler statements, ranging from trivial to
textbook level, which help validate the correctness of the underlying formalizations. Including such simpler problems helps detect incorrect formalizations of open problems: a disproof
of an easy special case or known variant might indicate that some of the definitions used
have been stated incorrectly. See below for examples of how those initial misformalizations
can lead to improved formal and informal problem statements. We strive to always state
the simplest open variant of a conjecture, as well as the conjecture in greater generality.
The @[category] attribute. To help navigate this collection, each statement is labeled with
one of the following category tags: research open (an open research-level problem), research
solved (a solved research-level problem), textbook (a textbook-level math problem ranging
from high school to graduate level), API (statements developing foundational theory for a
new definition intended for general reuse), and test (a statement serving as a sanity check).
The distribution of all categories is in Figure 1 on the right.
The @[subject] attribute. Statements are also labeled with subject tags following the
AMS Mathematics Subject Classification [Editors of Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH,
2020]. The distribution by source collection and AMS subject classification is shown in
Tables 3 and 4 (Appendix A.1). While number theory and combinatorics account for over
half of all statements, the benchmark already spans over 10 AMS subjects (e.g., also quantum
theory, or algebraic geometry), which we aim to broaden further.
3.2

Formalization Methodology

All problems are presented as Lean theorems with informal statements. While our core goal
is providing open statements with sorry placeholders for AI solvers to replace, we also include
solved variants of conjectures and items from problem lists. For open problems, no proofs
are provided. For solved items, we appreciate very short proofs or counterexamples (under
25–50 lines) that test the definitions. Longer proofs are excluded to keep the repository
lightweight; instead, contributors are encouraged to host proofs in their own repositories
and link to them using the @[formal_proof] mechanism described below.
4

We provide an example statement in Figure 3.
The answer(sorry) mechanism. Many mathematical problems ask not just for a proof
but for a specific answer: a number, a function, or a set. To handle this, we introduce
an answer(sorry) construct, implemented as a custom Lean term elaborator, that separates
the task of discovering a computable answer from proving it correct. For example, “What
is the smallest n such that P (n)?” is formalized with answer(sorry) as a placeholder that
a solver must replace with a concrete value, reducing the problem to a verifiable proof
obligation. The construct also handles unknown truth values: when answer(sorry) appears
in a biconditional, a solver replaces it with True or False to conjecture or refute a proposition.
See Appendix A.2 for detailed examples and the full elaboration semantics.
The “for Mathlib” pattern. The project maintains a FormalConjecturesForMathlib directory containing 88 files of auxiliary definitions and lemmas not yet in Mathlib but needed
for conjectures. These results are asynchronously contributed upstream to Mathlib. See Appendix A.3 for details on the rationale and contents of this directory.
The @[formal_proof] attribute. To keep the repository lightweight, the @[formal_proof]
attribute decouples problem statements from their solutions. It supports three modes:
(1) formal_conjectures for proofs solving exactly the type of the statement given here; it
should point to a commit on top of a commit in the main branch of our repo, filling in the
sorry; (2) lean4 for equivalent problems solved in Lean 4 elsewhere (e.g., in Mathlib or external repos); and (3) other_system for problems solved in other systems like Lean 3, Isabelle,
or Rocq. This design links to external verification sources while keeping the repository
maintainable. The attribute applies to any solved category, though usage on a research open
problem triggers a linter warning. Table 1 summarizes proof coverage recorded via this
attribute.
3.3

Misformalizations

It is notoriously diﬀicult to formalize a mathematical problem correctly without providing
a formal proof. A misformalization is a formal statement that is incorrect. To provide a
rigorous foundation for benchmark quality, we introduce a taxonomy of misformalizations.
It includes the following levels, where in all cases the formal statement is incorrect.
1. Translation: the informal statement is accurate and explicitly phrased.
2. Underspecified: the informal statement is accurate but lacks detail.
3. Source: the informal statement is not as intended.
These levels are ordered with respect to the degree of contribution from the formalizer. Level
1 misformalizations arise from the formalization only, while level 3 misformalizations arise
from the informal text only. Moreover, for a Lean expert who does not necessarily have
domain expertise in the informal statements, levels are ordered with respect to diﬀiculty
to fix. Note that level 2 and 3 misformalizations have been useful in clarifying informal
statements in the literature. An illustrative example is Erdős Problem 978: multiple attempts to formalize the statement led to a refinement of the original informal problem3 .
The original statement, “Are there infinitely many n for which f (n) is (k − 2)-power-free?”,
was found to require multiple additional hypotheses and became: “If k > 3, and for all
primes p there exists n such that pk−2 ∤ f (n), then are there infinitely many n for which
f (n) is (k − 2)-power-free?” More broadly, informal texts may exclude trivial cases without
explicitly describing them, while formalization requires these to be explicit.
Misformalizations can further be categorized into six types across the three levels: syntactic,
semantic, and misrepresentation errors at the translation level; implicit conventions at the
underspecified level; and reporting and mathematical errors at the source level. The full
taxonomy with definitions and representative pull requests is given in Appendix A.4. Across
the repository a total of 291 misformalizations have been fixed, with misrepresentation (48%)

these misformalization examples can be found in Appendix A.5.

3.4

Avoiding Misformalizations

In Formal Conjectures, every contribution undergoes mandatory code review by humans
with both Lean expertise and relevant mathematical domain knowledge. While early
contributions to the repository were written entirely by hand, the authoring process has
evolved: most recent submissions use AI tooling, including agentic coding assistants and
auto-formalization systems. To facilitate high-quality AI-assisted contributions, the repository provides an AGENTS.md file with structured guidance for these tools. Similarly, the
review process increasingly leverages AI: reviewers use language models to cross-check formalizations against informal sources, and AlphaProof runs on submissions to catch potential
misformalizations before merging.
Beyond this review process, we employ a number of additional strategies to mitigate the
risk of misformalizations across the dataset. Firstly, we employ and encourage a test-based
design for definitions. Any new definitions introduced should be accompanied by a suite
of proven test lemmas and API statements that are designed to establish expected behavior of the definition and mitigate the risk of edge-case errors. Lean and Mathlib’s tooling
(for example decide) can be employed to prove many of these test statements. As of the
bench-v1-lean4.27.0 release, the repository contains 467 test statements and 155 API statements, amounting to 23.8% of the repository statements.
Secondly, automated theorem provers like AlphaProof regularly attempt proofs and disproofs across the repository (Figure 4); manually inspecting these results primarily reveals
misformalizations. In contrast to test-based design, which proactively reduces the risk of
edge-case errors, this retroactive approach is capable of unearthing misformalizations across
all categories as described in Section 3.3. In addition, we use Gemini, AlphaProof, and
other tools to automatically cross-check formalizations against their informal source texts,
flagging potential discrepancies for human review. Future work involves further automating
these processes in GitHub CI in order to reduce the overhead of manual post-hoc fixes from
the maintainers.
Thirdly, custom Lean linters built on Mathlib’s framework enforce metadata and documentation standards across contributions. These cover AMS classification tags, answer(sorry)
usage, problem category annotations, and module docstrings.
Finally, as Formal Conjectures has grown in stature, community engagement and proof/disproof attempts from external automated theorem provers have been increasingly valuable. Furthermore, insights and corrections discovered through this process are actively
upstreamed to the original sources, e.g., prompting the maintainer of the Erdős problems
website to regularly clarify and adjust the informal problem statements.

Benchmark Evaluation

4.1

Evaluation Framework

Evaluation Paradigms. Formal Conjectures provides a dynamic, rigorous benchmark
for advanced automated reasoning premised on novel mathematical insight as the ultimate
intellectual hurdle for complex problems. We define two distinct setups:
1. Primary Goal: New Formal Proof Discovery. Measuring AI’s ability to
discover formal proofs for open problems, these unsolved conjectures form a zerocontamination testbed for genuine mathematical discovery. Since no solutions exist
in any training corpus, success provides a definitive signal of reasoning capabilities,
removing the need for secretive evaluation sets common in other benchmarks.
2. Secondary Goal: Proof Auto-formalization. This track provides a climbable
benchmark treating the non-trivial translation of established mathematics into formal code as a distinct, rigorous challenge. It measures a model’s ability to work
with Lean 4 and Mathlib to formalize known arguments.
Evaluating Open Problems. Evaluating open problems is definitive: as no formal solutions exist at release time, the first kernel-accepted proof provides a zero-contamination
success signal. However, since a proof may settle a misformalized statement rather than the
intended problem, any result for an open conjecture triggers manual inspection for fidelity.
Fixed Benchmark Subsets. To enable stable model comparisons, we provide two
frozen subsets of 100 problems each: FC100OpenSet1 (100 research open statements) and
FC100SolvedSet1 (100 research solved statements). These subsets are defined in the repository files FC100OpenSet1.lean and FC100SolvedSet1.lean, which import exactly the corresponding theorem statements. Because these files are compiled as part of the repository
across all supported Lean versions, the problem sets remain fixed and comparable even
as the repository evolves. Further details on the construction of these subsets are in Appendix B.1.
Correctness. Following established formal math benchmark methodologies [Zheng et al.,
2021, Tsoukalas et al., 2024], our evaluation leverages the Lean 4 kernel for an objective,
rigorous, and automatable success criterion. A proposed solution is a Lean proof term replacing the sorry placeholder. Solutions are correct if and only if accepted by the kernel
without relying on forbidden axioms, such as sorry. This binary criterion eliminates human
grading ambiguity and provides an indisputable ground truth. While theoretically susceptible to foundational bugs in the Lean kernel or unintended axioms (e.g., a Lean Zulip thread4 ,
which mentions a now-fixed exploit), in practice, kernel-level verification provides the highest mathematical rigor. Consequently, all evaluations are automatically verifiable, allowing
results and proof terms to be shared publicly for transparent, reproducible research.
Versioning and Reproducibility. Evaluating on a living repository is challenging: dependency updates can alter statement semantics, and new Mathlib theorems may simplify
problems. To enable reproducible comparisons, we tag frozen benchmark snapshots using
a two-part naming scheme: bench-vN -lean4.X .Y . The bench version vN identifies a fixed
problem set; the Lean version suﬀix pins the Mathlib tag (and hence Lean toolchain) against
which statements compile and are evaluated. Releases are issued every few months; when
Lean versions bump, companion tags allow evaluating the same problem set against intermediate toolchains, e.g. bench-v3-lean4.27.0. To preserve baselines, snapshots are immutable;
misformalization fixes are never patched into existing versions but incorporated into the
next (e.g., bench-v(N+1)).
A Living Benchmark and Unified API. Outside the frozen subsets, the repository
operates as a dynamic benchmark that exhibits useful evaluation dynamics over time. As

new conjectures are added, solved, or corrected by the community, it naturally self-adjusts its
diﬀiculty, expands, and improves. The hardest problems remain open, pushing the frontier
of automated reasoning. Crucially, the repository acts as a unified API: researchers can
submit formalized conjectures to a single centralized hub for simultaneous exposure to all
evaluating AI systems. This obviates the need to manually engage with individual provers,
ensuring broad and concurrent attempts at mathematical discovery.
Open Problems Baseline. For the primary proof-discovery task on open problems, the
baseline for the first tagged release bench-v1-lean4.27 is 0% for all systems: by definition,
no formal proof exists for any research open statement at the time of tagging (problems
with known solutions are reclassified as research solved). Over time, these open statements
may receive formal or informal proofs. Proofs that expose a misformalization (Section 3.3)
rather than settling the intended problem trigger revisions incorporated into the next version.
In subsequent releases, interim-solved problems are reclassified to research solved, with
formal solutions receiving the @[formal_proof] attribute. The new research open set combines
remaining unsolved problems with new additions; thus, successive versions start with a
baseline of ≥ 0% solved statements and become increasingly more diﬀicult.
Proof Auto-Formalization Baseline. For auto-formalization, the baseline is systemagnostic: we track all formal proofs contributed to the repository, regardless of origin. These
are tracked using the @[formal_proof] attribute (Section 3.2), which records the proof system
(formal_conjectures for proofs within the repository, lean4 for proofs in external Lean 4
projects such as Mathlib, or other_system for proofs in Isabelle, Rocq, etc.) and links
to the source. Table 1 summarizes the current state. Notably, 17.3% of research_solved
statements have a known formal proof (5.3% internal, 12.1% linked externally).

signal across both compute and model capabilities. To provide a diverse evaluation, we
evaluate both a slightly improved version of the AlphaProof system used in the 2024 IMO
[Hubert et al., 2025] and a development version of a DeepMind prover agent [DeepMind,
2026]. These are different systems rather than incremental versions of the same architecture.
Utilizing a constrained tree-search-only inference setup on v6e TPUs, AlphaProof achieves

a solve rate of 45% on FC100SolvedSet1 with a low compute configuration of 1,000 simulations per problem. By increasing the compute budget to 16,000 simulations, the solve rate
improves to 50%, demonstrating a clear scaling signal. We emphasize that these evaluations
are conducted using tree-search inference only and do not utilize AlphaProof’s test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) mechanism, which generates a curriculum to learn from during
the proof finding process through weight updates. Furthermore, utilizing a newer, development version of the DeepMind prover agent, the solve rate increases to 66%, illustrating
that the benchmark effectively measures advancements across improved model architectures
and methodologies. Because running automated reasoning methods within Lean involves
significant infrastructure overhead, we provide these specific systems as illustrative baselines
to validate the benchmark’s signal. We encourage the community to report results against
these subsets as well as the evolving main repository.

Discussion

Broader Benefits. Beyond its primary role, Formal Conjectures provides precise mathematics by enforcing a level of formal precision that clarifies the exact meaning of statements. This creates a library of conjectures referenced unambiguously via unique file names
and commit hashes, ensuring fixed and verifiable mathematical intent; unlike standard citations where generality or precision is often left to interpretation. Furthermore, the benchmark serves as a compass for Mathlib development, as formalizing advanced conjectures
reveals gaps in the existing library. We address these via FormalConjecturesForMathlib,
a directory of results continuously upstreamed to Mathlib. By identifying hard-to-state
concepts, the repository both benchmarks reasoning and expands formalized mathematics.
Limitations. Problem selection faces a scope bias constrained by Mathlib’s current coverage, which we mitigate somewhat via our ForMathlib directory. While some concepts
remain hard to formalize, this limitation will diminish as Mathlib expands. There is also
a selection bias toward famous conjectures and Erdős problems, resulting in a concentration of number theory and combinatorics; we plan to mitigate this by sourcing diverse arXiv
preprints in areas like computer science and physics. Focusing on open problems introduces
a misformalization risk from subtle statement or source errors. While mitigated via
new methods in Section 3.4, these risks remain until a full proof is provided; fixing newly
discovered errors may require revisions impacting historical comparisons. The benchmark
also faces contamination challenges: for solved problems, models may retrieve known
arguments rather than reasoning from scratch; for open problems, zero-contamination is not
permanent as future solutions enter training data. Our living repository tracks these developments and reclassifies problems accordingly. Finally, verification and reproducibility
rely on the Lean 4 kernel’s integrity; while the theoretical exploitability of foundational
bugs or unintended axioms is a general challenge for formal systems, it remains the highest
standard for rigor. To ensure stable results despite the repository’s evolution, we provide
frozen, versioned subsets for standardized evaluation.
Future Work. As an active open-source project, we are committed to maintaining and extending Formal Conjectures with new problems, improved problems, and platform features;
this ongoing commitment is reflected in the repository’s steady growth since its initial release
(see Figure 2). See Appendix C for details on planned extensions, metadata improvements,
and community features.

Conclusion

We present Formal Conjectures, an evolving collection of mathematical problem statements formalized in Lean 4, including open conjectures. Sourced from a diverse range of
mathematical literature and areas, the benchmark provides broad coverage as an evaluation
framework for AI systems’ capabilities in formal math. By providing a zero-contamination
testbed of research-level problems alongside a substantial set for proof auto-formalization,
we establish a rigorous environment for evaluating AI for formal mathematical research.
Crucially, to ensure stable and reproducible model comparisons as the repository evolves,
9

we complement this dynamic dataset with versioned, frozen evaluation subsets. We hope
the work can drive the expansion of formalized math: both through its living repository and
the continuous upstreaming of new definitions to Mathlib, as well as serve as a high-fidelity
benchmark that bridges the gap between human mathematical expertise and automated formal reasoning. Ultimately, we believe this resource will not only measure current progress
but also help accelerate the frontier of formal mathematical discovery.

Source and AMS Classification Tables

Note that a single source problem typically gives rise to multiple formal statements due
to variants (e.g., special cases, generalizations, solved sub-problems, and test lemmas). We
explicitly allow and encourage the inclusion of multiple alternative formalizations for a single
informal claim to capture different mathematical perspectives or resolutions of ambiguity;
thus, the counts in this table reflect formal statements, not distinct source problems.

The answer(sorry) Mechanism in Detail

Problems requiring a solution are formalized using answer( ), a custom Lean term elaborator.
Concretely, a problem like “What is the smallest n such that P (n)?” is formalized as:
theorem smallest_n : IsLeast {n : ℕ | P n} answer(sorry) := by
sorry

13

As usual, sorry is a placeholder which must be filled in order to claim that a problem
is solved, but now there are two of them. If the solution is known, then answer(sorry)
is replaced in the statement with answer(42). This mechanism allows our statements to
include computational conjectures where discovering the answer is the primary challenge
and verification is routine.
Crucially, while providing a proof simply requires finding any way to replace := sorry with
a valid term, providing an answer is a fundamentally different task: it requires evaluating
mathematical meaning to determine the correct value. Lean’s type checker can verify that
a proposed answer leads to a valid proof, but it cannot judge whether the answer itself is
mathematically meaningful—that remains a job for human mathematicians or AI systems
with genuine mathematical reasoning capabilities.
There are a number of advantages to using the answer( ) wrapper over directly writing a
solution or a bare sorry placeholder:
• It makes clear which part of the formalization corresponds to the solution; this allows
the solution to be masked from research solved statements in order to evaluate
agents. This can either be done by inspecting the metadata inserted in the Lean
term, or more pragmatically, by a simple regex replacement.
• It provides some protection against Lean’s flexible elaboration; a problem stated as
1 / 2 * 2 = sorry could be solved by replacing the sorry with either (0 : ℕ) or (1
: ℚ), as by default, Lean only infers the type of an equality after analyzing both
sides. This is clearly undesirable; we do not want the meaning of our questions to
change depending on the answer provided! Stating the problem instead as 1 / 2 *
2 = answer(sorry) protects against this, as the answer elaborator postpones analysis
which forces Lean to decide the type of the equality before seeing the solution.
• It forces the statement to be written in such a way that does not pre-assume what
the solution is.
A.2.1 Propositional Solutions
A particularly common use case arises when the truth value of a proposition P is itself
unknown, i.e. when the problem can be phrased as a question: ”Is it true that...”. In this
case, answer(sorry) serves as a propositional placeholder that should be replaced with either
True or False:
theorem is_P_true : answer(sorry) ↔ P := by
sorry

Replacing answer(sorry) with True amounts to conjecturing that P holds (and the solver
must prove P ), while replacing it with False amounts to conjecturing that P fails (and the
solver must disprove P ). This pattern is widely used throughout the repository for open
problems where even the expected truth value is uncertain.
For the convenience of evaluating solver systems that are capable of filling proofs only, when
answer(sorry) is detected to be used propositionally in this way, it elaborates to True under
its default settings. This permits these systems to decide the proposition by either proving
or disproving the statement, rather than by filling the placeholder.
A.3

The “for Mathlib” Pattern

It is typical when undertaking formalization projects to discover missing (and often trivial)
results that seem suitable for Mathlib. Contributing these results to Mathlib is of course
the natural resolution, but this has a number of downsides:
• New conjectures that depend on these results find themselves at the end of a long
dependency chain; the missing results must undergo Mathlib review, the merged
change must land in a monthly Mathlib release, and the Formal Conjectures repository must be upgraded to that release
14

• Some results may be too specialized for Mathlib, and a Mathlib contribution would
require generalizing these immediately.
• When the results entail a whole new mathematical development, it may take time for
the Mathlib community to find the right abstractions and evolve said development
into the right shape. Bypassing the dependency chain mentioned above allows much
of this evolution to happen more rapidly outside of Mathlib.
The Lean community has widely adopted the pattern of creating a ForMathlib directory as a staging ground for such results, the oldest example of which being the
for_mathlib directory in the “liquid tensor experiment”5 . The formal-conjectures project’s
FormalConjecturesForMathlib directory follows this pattern, and contains 88 files with results such as natural and logarithmic density of sets of natural numbers (with proofs of basic
properties like monotonicity and the density of even numbers), arithmetic progressions and
AP-free sets, hypergraph Ramsey numbers, Turing machines and busy beaver halting numbers, perfect powers with a decidability instance, VC dimension in abelian groups, Latin
squares and transversals, and a library of graph invariants including the Wiener and Szeged
indices, the Lovász theta function, and the Havel–Hakimi residue. Over time, these results
are asynchronously contributed upstream to Mathlib.
A.4

Misformalization Taxonomy

Misformalizations can be categorized roughly as follows, with the level shown in parentheses.6
• Syntactic (1): where the formalizer misses a subtlety in the way Lean parses a
piece of syntax. For example, this could be missing brackets changing the meaning
of an expression in unexpected ways; see PR #1338.
• Semantic (1): where the formalizer misses a subtlety in the way that Lean represents types or operators. For example, the natural numbers in Lean contain 0 and
have truncated subtraction; see PRs #349, #1259, #1262.
• Misrepresentation (1): where the formalizer formally misrepresents aspects of
the informal statement during translation. For example, the use of incorrect quantifiers, the use of incorrect logical connectives, or the failure to include hypotheses
which are present in the source text; see PRs #1164, #1156.
• Implicit conventions (2): where the source text assumes domain expertise and
does not explicitly include certain hypotheses or conventions. For example, in analytic number theory, questions about the magnitude of a set of numbers are often
implicitly asymptotic; see PRs #2136, #1151.
• Reporting (3): where the statement changes in the literature through repetition,
usually as the result of typos; see Erdős Problem 918 discussion.
• Mathematical (3): where the source text is clearly not as intended or contains
genuine mathematical errors; see Erdős Problem 728 discussion.

An example of a syntactical error involving the correction of misplaced parentheses is shown
in Figure 5.

the subtlety that Partition invokes sup for the covering condition, which means something
different for subgroups than for sets.

A.5.3 Misrepresentation Errors
Figure 9 provides an example of a misrepresentation error where a hypothesis from the
informal text was omitted, and Figure 10 shows an error involving incorrect quantification.
/-- A (weak) Giuga number is a number $n$ such that

V was incorrectly quantified. In the old version V was a section variable and thus appeared

out of the scope of the existential quantifier.
A.5.4 Implicit Conventions
Examples of errors stemming from implicit conventions in the source material can be seen
in Figures 11 and 12.
@[category research open, AMS 11]

Figure 11: Code diff showing an example of an implicit convention, where the source8
implicitly assumes that the inequality holds for suﬀiciently large N . This is a common
implicit convention across analytic number theory where one is typically interested in the
asymptotic behavior of functions or sequences of natural numbers.

Figure 12: Code diff showing an example of an implicit convention, where the source11
wrote “subgraph” rather than “induced subgraph”. The comments12 demonstrate that the
problem is trivial if one does not restrict to induced subgraphs, which is why we class this
as implicit convention. It might also be considered to be a reporting error since the original
paper explicitly writes “induced subgraph”, [Erdős, 1993, p. 344].
A.5.5 Reporting Errors
Figure 13 demonstrates a reporting error caused by ambiguities in the historical source
material regarding induced subgraphs.

Figure 13: Code diff showing an example of a reporting error between an internal draft
formalization of the problem. This problem appears in Erdős and Hajnal [1968] and Erdős
[1969]. In the former citation the explicit use of ≤ ℵ0 is used, while this does not appear
in the latter citation. This ambiguity was only clarified post draft formalization with the
discovery of trivial solutions – in the (non-induced) subgraph case by the website comments14
and by AlphaProof in the induced subgraph case. Note also that Erdős and Hajnal [1968]
explicitly writes induced subgraph while Erdős [1969] and the website do not.

Experimental Evaluation Details

Frozen Subsets

The frozen subsets FC100SolvedSet1 and FC100OpenSet1 consist of 100 problems each, sampled
uniformly at random from statements in the research solved and research open categories,
respectively. They are defined by the files FormalConjectures/Subsets/FC100OpenSet1.lean
and FormalConjectures/Subsets/FC100SolvedSet1.lean in the repository, which import exactly the corresponding theorem statements. These files are compiled as part of every
tagged release, ensuring that the problem sets remain well-defined and their statements
compile correctly across all supported Lean versions.

The subset names (e.g., FC100OpenSet1) are orthogonal to the repository’s release tags
(bench-vN -lean4.X .Y , see Section 4.1). When the bench version N stays the same and
only the Lean version changes (e.g., from bench-v1-lean4.27.0 to bench-v1-lean4.29.0),
the problem set is guaranteed to contain the same statements; the new tag only ensures
compilation against the updated Lean toolchain and Mathlib. When the bench version increments (e.g., from bench-v1 to bench-v2), statements in an existing set may receive fixes
(e.g., corrected misformalizations) or category updates (e.g., an open problem reclassified as
solved), but the membership of the set remains stable: no problems are added or removed.
For full reproducibility, results should specify both the set name and the release tag, e.g.,
FC100SolvedSet1@bench-v1-lean4.27.0.
In the future, we plan to release additional sets (e.g., FC100SolvedSet2, FC500OpenSet1) that
may contain entirely different problems, enabling targeted evaluations at different scales or
diﬀiculty levels while preserving earlier sets.

Illustrative Evaluation Details

As noted in Section 4.2, our evaluations focus on demonstrating the benchmark’s utility
and its sensitivity to scaling. For all systems, a solution is correct if and only if the Lean 4
kernel accepts the proof term without relying on forbidden axioms.
AlphaProof Setup. We evaluated a slightly updated version of AlphaProof [Hubert et al.,
2025], with tree-search inference, without the test-time reinforcement learning loop. As
reported in Table 2, we distinguish between two compute configurations for AlphaProof to
demonstrate the benchmark’s sensitivity to search budget: 1k sims utilizes 1,000 simulations
and 2 attempts per problem (approximately 0.1 TPUh on v6e TPUs); and 16k sims and 2
attempts (approximately 1.6 TPUh on v6e TPUs).
DeepMind Prover Agent Setup. The DeepMind prover agent [DeepMind, 2026] results
were obtained using a development version of the method under active experimentation.
Based on current API pricing, this evaluation costs up to $100 per problem.

Extended Discussion

Future Work

We plan to continuously extend Formal Conjectures with new problems unblocked by newly
added Mathlib definitions or from community contributions. While our implementation
uses Lean 4, the methodology is language-agnostic and portable to systems like Isabelle
or Rocq should they develop comparable library support. We will also track future Lean
updates to maintain ecosystem compatibility. To better evaluate the diﬀiculty and impact
of conjectures, we plan to extend the metadata by recording when a conjecture was first
proposed. This objective metric will enable users to filter for long-standing open problems
versus contemporary questions. However, since diﬀiculty and importance are often subjective, we also propose an interactive interface where the community can share insights. Users
will be able to vote on a conjecture’s perceived diﬀiculty, its mathematical significance, and
their conviction regarding its truth value (e.g., True, False, or independent of ZFC).
Furthermore, references to the mathematical literature are currently handled inconsistently
across the repository, often requiring duplication in each file. We plan to improve this by
centralizing reference management in future iterations.
This vision is being integrated into an accompanying website15 for the repository. The
website already serves as a frontend for the benchmark, allowing users to explore the source
code, view LATEX-rendered docstrings, and search, sort, or filter conjectures. It also contains
metadata recording when a research open problem gets solved or when a research solved problem receives a formal proof; in the future, we plan to make these changes more prominently
visible.

Moving forward, we plan to expand this platform into a collaborative hub with interactive
community features, including a public leaderboard to track successful AI-based solutions
and recognize groups taking on these problems.
