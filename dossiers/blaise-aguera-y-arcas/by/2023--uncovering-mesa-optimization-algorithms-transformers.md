# Uncovering mesa-optimization algorithms in Transformers

## Full text

### Abstract (from OpenAlex metadata)

Transformers have become the dominant model in deep learning, but the reason for their superior performance is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that the strong performance of Transformers stems from an architectural bias towards mesa-optimization, a learned process running within the forward pass of a model consisting of the following two steps: (i) the construction of an internal learning objective, and (ii) its corresponding solution found through optimization. To test this hypothesis, we reverse-engineer a series of autoregressive Transformers trained on simple sequence modeling tasks, uncovering underlying gradient-based mesa-optimization algorithms driving the generation of predictions. Moreover, we show that the learned forward-pass optimization algorithm can be immediately repurposed to solve supervised few-shot tasks, suggesting that mesa-optimization might underlie the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. Finally, we propose a novel self-attention layer, the mesa-layer, that explicitly and efficiently solves optimization problems specified in context. We find that this layer can lead to improved performance in synthetic and preliminary language modeling experiments, adding weight to our hypothesis that mesa-optimization is an important operation hidden within the weights of trained Transformers.

Some autoregressive models exhibit in-context learning capabilities: being able to learn as an input
sequence is processed, without undergoing any parameter changes, and without being explicitly trained
to do so. The origins of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Here we analyze a series of
Transformer models trained to perform synthetic sequence prediction tasks, and discover that standard
next-token prediction error minimization gives rise to a subsidiary learning algorithm that adjusts the
model as new inputs are revealed. We show that this process corresponds to gradient-based optimization
of a principled objective function, which leads to strong generalization performance on unseen sequences.
Our findings explain in-context learning as a product of autoregressive loss minimization and inform
the design of new optimization-based Transformer layers.
We are currently witnessing a paradigm shift in machine learning. Specialized models trained on large
labeled data sets are being replaced by generalist foundation models trained with self-supervision [1]. There
is increasing evidence that these models can adapt to
a wide range of tasks after a brief period of supervised learning (‘fine-tuning’). Intriguingly, some foundation models are capable of learning directly from
contextual input data, without having been explicitly
designed or trained to do so. In this way, parameter fine-tuning can often be sidestepped altogether,
making on-the-fly adaptation to new tasks possible
simply by providing examples in context. This powerful yet puzzling phenomenon, known as in-context
learning [2], was first observed in autoregressive large
language models (LLMs).
A number of recent theoretical studies have begun to
shed light on how in-context learning works, and why
it arises. A seminal analysis of Transformers, the backbone architecture [3] of the majority of LLMs, identified a two-layer circuit mechanism called ‘induction
head’ responsible for in-context learning in shallow
networks, and provided evidence for its likely involvement in deeper and more complex networks [4, 5]. A
complementary line of work has shown that in-context
learning can emerge in small-scale models, as long as
the data distribution displays certain properties [6, 7],
and that it can vanish under long training times [8].
Building on prior recurrent neural network studies [9–
12], yet another line of investigation has studied the
metalearning abilities of Transformers, explicitly training the models to solve supervised learning problems
in-context [13–16]. In such a setup, in-context learn-

ing is no longer an emergent phenomenon, but is
‘forced’ by the training regime, simplifying the analysis. Our previous work showing that Transformers
solve linear regression tasks by gradient descent [17],
later followed by a series of refined studies and mathematical analyses [18–26], falls under the same category as it also relies on explicit metalearning.
In this paper, we continue to analyze the in-context
learning abilities of Transformers, but shift our focus to autoregressive sequence prediction tasks. Like
LLMs—and most sequence models—we train Transformers in a self-supervised manner by minimizing a
next-token prediction error objective. Based on our
previous results on metalearned Transformers [17],
we then investigate whether the prediction algorithm
learned by autoregressive Transformers can be interpreted as gradient-based learning on a suitable contextual objective function. We find that this holds
true for a range of synthetic sequence modeling tasks.
In such a controlled synthetic data setting, we identify a gradient-based learning mechanism spanning
multiple Transformer layers. We refer to this mechanism as a ‘mesa-optimizer’ to emphasize that it is
acquired through training, as opposed to being inherent to the model [see 27]. The mesa-optimizer
adapts the model as new contextual information becomes available, enabling it to improve its predictions
with near-optimal sample efficiency. Moreover, the
same mechanism enables learning downstream tasks
from contextual demonstrations only. Taken together,
our results explain, at least in the settings we have
considered, the emergence of in-context learning in
Transformers trained only to predict the next token.

Uncovering mesa-optimization algorithms in Transformers

Results
We study autoregressive sequence modeling tasks
where the goal is to causally predict, at every time
step 𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑇 − 1, the next element 𝑒𝑡+1 in a sequence of tokens 𝑒 = ( 𝑒𝑡 )𝑡𝑇=1 , given the past ( 𝑒𝑡′ )𝑡𝑡′ =1 as
context.
We examine a range of causally masked Transformer
models [3] trained to solve such problems, from simple attention-only models to full-fledged deep Transformers comprising multiple attention layers, layer
normalization [LayerNorm; 28], and nonlinear multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks, cf. Materials and Methods. The objective of training is to find a set of parameters 𝜃 that minimize the cumulative next-token
prediction error

L ( 𝜃) = 𝔼𝑒∼ 𝑝 ( 𝑒 )
∥ 𝑒𝑡+1 − 𝑓𝑡 ( 𝑒1:𝑡 , 𝜃) ∥ 2 , (1)

where 𝑓𝑡 ( 𝑒1:𝑡 , 𝜃) denotes the Transformer output conditioned on the context 𝑒1:𝑡 , and the expectation is taken
over the sequence distribution 𝑝 ( 𝑒), which we describe
next. We focus on continuous-state problems, with
𝑒𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑒 , and take the squared error as the per-timestep loss, the standard objective for autoregressive
problems with continuous outputs.
Our Transformers are trained on synthetic sequences ( 𝑠𝑡 )𝑡𝑇=1 of observations 𝑠𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑠 generated by
discrete-time dynamical systems. As we detail in Materials and Methods, we consider a range of sequence
generators described in state-space representation:
(i) linear systems with full observability (𝑠𝑡 = ℎ𝑡 ) of
the internal system state ℎ𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑛ℎ ; (ii) partially-observed linear systems, where we only allow access to a
low-dimensional state projection, 𝑠𝑡 = 𝐶 ∗ ℎ𝑡 ; (iii) nonlinear dynamics, with state transitions governed by
nonlinear neural networks. Typically, each token corresponds to one observation, 𝑒𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡 , but we also study
tokenization schemes that aggregate several observations within one token. These aggregate token representations play an important role in the theory we
develop below.
Next-token prediction by mesa-optimization
In this paper, we hypothesize that training Transformers on next-token prediction tasks as described above
installs a gradient-based, in-context optimization algorithm in the forward pass of the model. Following the
terminology of Hubinger et al. [27], we refer to this
hypothetical acquired process as mesa-optimization,
to distinguish it from the base-optimization of Eq. 1,
over which we have explicit control.
More concretely, we hypothesize that generating
the future-token prediction 𝑓𝑡 ( 𝑒1:𝑡 , 𝜃) involves using
the current and past tokens 𝑒1:𝑡 to build a sequencespecific latent model on the fly. We focus on the case

where this model is linear in its parameters, which we
denote by Φ.
According to our mesa-optimization hypothesis,
trained Transformers successively learn a sequence of
such parameters Φ𝑡 as input tokens are gradually revealed, by minimizing an in-context objective function
𝐿𝑡 ( 𝑒1:𝑡 , Φ) using gradient information ∇Φ 𝐿𝑡 ( 𝑒1:𝑡 , Φ).
The resulting in-context models are then used to generate the Transformer predictions. It is important to
appreciate that these in-context latent models and
their learning rules are not explicitly hardwired in the
Transformer design, but are instead a by-product of
base-optimization. The parameters Φ may thus be
thought of as an implicit type of fast (i.e., sequencespecific) weights [29, 30] which live in the short-term
memory of a Transformer model, not in its learned
parameters.
Before verifying whether our hypothesis holds for
trained models, we first show that in theory, autoregressive linear Transformers are capable of optimizing quadratic loss functions in-context. We show this
constructively, by providing a set of parameters 𝜃
such that a linear Transformer implements a mesaoptimizer. This construction will then guide our analyses of trained models.
Theory of self-attention mesa-optimizers
Our first theoretical result concerns a single layer of
causally-masked self-attention, the architectural component at the heart of an autoregressive Transformer;
we will later consider deeper, more complex architectures. Given an input sequence ( 𝑒𝑡 )𝑡𝑇=1 , one such
layer with 𝐻 heads updates each token 𝑒𝑡 ← 𝑒𝑡 + Δ𝑒sa

following the rule
Δ𝑒sa
𝑡 =

ℎ=1

where 𝑞ℎ,𝑡 = 𝑊ℎ,𝑞 𝑒𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑎 is referred to as a query,
each column 𝑘ℎ,𝑡′ = 𝑊ℎ,𝑘 𝑒𝑡′ ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑎 of matrix 𝐾ℎ,𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑎 ×𝑡
as a key, and each column 𝑣ℎ,𝑡′ = 𝑊ℎ,𝑣 𝑒𝑡′ ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑣 of matrix 𝑉ℎ,𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑣 ×𝑡 as a value. The parameters of this layer
are the projection matrices {( 𝑃ℎ , 𝑊ℎ,𝑞 , 𝑊ℎ,𝑘 , 𝑊ℎ,𝑣 )} ℎ𝐻=1
for all heads; we absorb bias terms, and assume here
for conciseness that all heads are equally sized. The
function 𝛼 applied to vector 𝑎 ∈ ℝ𝑡 returns an attention
weight vector. For the theoretical results presented below, we focus on the case where 𝛼 is the identity function, which yields the linear self-attention layer, the
main building block of linear Transformers [e.g., 31–
35]. In our experimental analyses, we also study standard (softmax) self-attention
layers, where 𝛼 ( 𝑎) 𝑖 =
Í
softmax( 𝑎) 𝑖 := ( 𝑡𝑡′ =1 exp( 𝑎𝑡′ )) −1 exp( 𝑎𝑖 ), present in
the original and still most popular Transformer architecture [3].

Figure 1 | Illustration of mesa-optimization in autoregressive Transformers. The neural dynamics implements an
optimization-based in-context learning algorithm, which
optimizes the parameters Φ of a linear model over a series
of causally-masked attention layers. Taking as inputs an
initial set of parameters Φ0 and a training set of input-target
pairs {( 𝑠𝑡′ , 𝑠𝑡′ +1 )}𝑡𝑡′−1
constructed from context, this process
=1
returns a prediction Φ̂𝑡 𝑠𝑡 obtained by applying the learned
model to the current input. Early layers implement a copy
operation which binds multiple consecutive tokens together,
in agreement with previous in-context learning analyses
[4, 5]. This aggregate-token representation enables the implementation of gradient-based optimizers in subsequent
attention layers, cf. Propositions 1 and 2.

where Φ ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑠 × 𝑛𝑠 parametrizes a first-order linear
autoregressive model which predicts 𝑠𝑡+1 from 𝑠𝑡 . We
show that one linear self-attention layer can implicitly
represent such a model in its activations, with mesaparameters Φ learned by a step of gradient descent
on the mesa-objective 𝐿𝑡 ( Φ).
Proposition 1 (1-step attention-based gradient descent). Given tokens of the form 𝑒𝑡 = [ Φ0 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 −1 ], for
𝑡 = 2, ..., 𝑇 , if the projection matrices 𝑊𝑘 , 𝑊𝑞 , 𝑊𝑣 , 𝑃 are

with 𝐼 𝑠 the identity matrix of size 𝑛𝑠 × 𝑛𝑠 , then the transformation of every token 𝑒𝑡 by one causally-masked linear
self-attentionhead is identical to the gradient-induced

update 𝑒𝑡 ← ( Φ0 − 𝜂∇ 𝐿𝑡 ( Φ0 )) 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 −1 .

Proposition 1 (proven in Materials and Methods)
is an immediate extension of the main result of von
Oswald et al. [17] to the autoregressive sequence modeling setting, where 𝑇 loss functions ( 𝐿𝑡 )𝑡 must be optimized in sequence, see Materials and Methods for
details. Since 𝐿𝑡 is the cumulative squared error up
to time 𝑡 , Proposition 1 implements a ‘full-batch’ gradient step. Notably, the self-attention layer executes
this step in all 𝑇 problems in parallel. We remark that
our construction assumes a special three-channel tokenization, where a single token encodes the current
input 𝑠𝑡 , the previous input 𝑠𝑡 −1 , and an initial prediction Φ0 𝑠𝑡 . As illustrated in Fig. 1, we will later show
that trained Transformers learn to internally produce
such encodings when driven by a standard-format
(𝑒𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡 ) sequence, but for now we proceed under the
assumption that the tokens are structured in such a
way.
We now turn to multi-layer, self-attention-only models. Here, we find that causally-masked autoregressive
modeling complicates the problem, in the sense that
stacking 𝑘 layers following Proposition 1 yields an unconventional biased algorithm that is expected to be
slower than 𝑘-step gradient descent, as analyzed in
[23]. There exists, however, an alternative unbiased
mesa-optimizer for multi-layer models, which introduces an additional layerwise operation for improving
the preconditioning of mesa-optimization. This algorithm again makes use of self-attention layers, now
employed to transform the input data. In the limit of
many such layers, a single gradient descent step then
yields the optimal (least-squares) mesa-optimization
solution.
Proposition 2 (Multi-attention-layer mesa-optimizer).
Assume we are given for every time step 𝑡 = 2, . . . , 𝑇 a
sequence of suitably-constructed input tokens ( 𝑒𝑡′ )𝑡𝑡′ =1 ,
and a regularized
mesa-objective we wish to minimize

in parallel for all 𝑡 in their forward pass, with approximation error decreasing with the number of linear selfattention layers 𝑘. As a consequence, in the many-layer
limit the Transformer can minimize the regularized
mesa-objective.
A concrete parameter construction and proof are
provided in the Materials and Methods.
Propositions 1 and 2 show that simplified Transformers can, at least in theory, minimize cumulative
squared-error objectives in-context, without any actual parameter (‘in-weights’) learning taking place.
As we shall see in our experimental section below,
these ideal constructions yield solutions to our syn-

thetic tasks, and they generate testable hypotheses
that inform our experiments with trained models. Before proceeding to our empirical analyses, we present
one last theoretical result motivated by the constructions above: a novel self-attention layer designed for
efficient least-squares in-context learning.
An attention layer for optimal least-squares learning
The mesa-optimizers discussed so far require in general many layers to reach a desired error. This observation leads us to develop the mesa-layer, a self-attention
layer derived from in-context optimization first principles. More concretely, we show that an appropriately
modified attention layer yields autoregressive leastsquares solutions in sequence and in a single step, a
computation that would otherwise require infinitely
many linear self-attention layers under Proposition 2.
Thus, if the mesa-optimization hypothesis advanced
in this paper describes actual trained standard Transformers, it should be possible to improve their performance by introducing such a layer in their architecture.
The mesa-layer therefore provides one additional way
of verifying the mesa-optimization hypothesis in experiments.
The mesa-layer changes a sequence of input tokens

Above, the (learnable) scalar 𝜆 ℎ−1 > 0 controls the
strength of a regularizer added to improve generalization, and key, value and query vectors are the usual
learned head-specific affine transformations of the tokens, as in Eq. 2. However, through Eq. 5 these vectors
are now assigned a precise, interpretable role: value
vectors specify targets to which an internal model with
parameters Φ should map training and test inputs, represented by keys and queries, respectively. We note
that the minimizer of a regularized squared-error objective can be mapped to Eq. 5 under an appropriate
tokenization (such as the one of Proposition 1) by appropriately setting the projection matrices 𝑊ℎ,𝑣 , 𝑊ℎ,𝑘
and 𝑊ℎ,𝑞 .
At any given time step 𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑇 computing Δ𝑒mesa
𝑡
requires solving a regularized least-squares problem
per attention head. To efficiently solve this sequence
of 𝑇 optimization problems, we leverage the recursive
dependency of the 𝑇 solutions, which can be expressed

in closed-form as

𝑡 ′ =1

As 𝜆 ℎ → 0, we recover a standard linear self-attention
layer. Thus, the mesa-layer strictly generalizes the
latter.
We now use the Sherman-Morrison formula [36]
to obtain the inverse at time 𝑡 from the inverse at
the previous time step 𝑡 − 1. This iterative update
is possible because we only change the inverse by a
rank-one update. The following solution scheme is
known as recursive least squares [37]:
𝑅ℎ,𝑡 = 𝑅ℎ,𝑡 −1 −

which requires 2 additional vector-matrix and 2 vectorvector multiplications per step compared to standard
self-attention.
Naive backward gradient computation requires storing matrices of dimension 𝑛𝑎 × 𝑛𝑎 in memory across
time. However, this memory overhead can be avoided
using the Sherman-Morrison formula in reverse during backpropagation, as we show in the SI Appendix,
enabling memory-efficient gradient computation of
the output of the mesa-layer w.r.t. its inputs. We note
that while the implementation described here has a
desirable O (1) inference memory cost, it is not parallelizable across time. This is a disadvantage for training on contemporary hardware shared with nonlinear
recurrent neural networks, but not with standard selfattention layers.
The mesa-layer is closely related to the Delta-Net
model of Schlag et al. [33], which is hardwired to do
one gradient descent step per time point. It can also
be seen as an adaptation of the intention layer proposed by Garnelo & Czarnecki [38] to the sequential,
autoregressive case. The latter corresponds exactly
to a non-causally-masked version of Eq. 6. Here, we
focus on the autoregressive setting, which leads us
to develop recursive forward and backward updates,
in order to achieve efficient sequential inference and
training.
Aggregate internal token representations develop
through training
We begin our empirical analysis of Transformer models trained by autoregressive loss (Eq. 1) minimization

Figure 2 | Early layers of trained autoregressive Transformers (blue lines) produce internal token representations that
support mesa-optimization by subsequent layers. Similar
results are obtained for standard deep Transformers and
new compact, two-layer model variants which feature the
mesa-layer (red lines). (A) After training, the past token
𝑒𝑡 ′ (𝑡 ′ = 49) can be almost perfectly linearly decoded from
the current (𝑡 = 50) output of the first Transformer layer.
The decoding horizon 𝑡 − 𝑡 ′ increases when the Transformer

by searching for evidence of an internal token binding
mechanism. Recall that Propositions 1 and 2 required
a non-standard token format, in which consecutive
observations were aggregated within a single token 𝑒𝑡 .
In our first set of experiments, we adopt a standard token format and provide only the current observation 𝑠𝑡
as the input 𝑒𝑡 to the model. The first prediction of our
theory is that training should install a token binding
mechanism, responsible for aggregating multi-timestep observation information within a single token.
We now show that this indeed occurs in actual trained
models.
In Fig. 2, we report the performance of linear decoders [probes; 39] trained to predict previous tokens
from the output of the first attention layer of a deep
Transformer model. We consider both standard Transformer models featuring seven softmax self-attention
layers, MLPs and LayerNorm, as well as a novel compact Transformer which combines one layer of softmax
self-attention and one mesa-layer, described in detail
in Materials and Methods. We relegate architectures
solely built out of mesa-layer models to the SI Appendix, as we found that these were generally outperformed by hybrid softmax-mesa architectures. We see
that after training it becomes possible to decode past
tokens from the present token (see also Fig. 1A), with
decoding horizon increasing for partially-observed
problems, for both standard softmax Transformers

and the novel hybrid softmax-mesa Transformers introduced in this paper. For the fully observed setting, the
probe error increases quickly when predicting more
than one step in the past, aligned with our token construction that binds together only consecutive tokens.
Moreover, when the models are trained on systems
with nonlinear dynamics, the performance of linear
probes that decode the hidden state of the sequence
generator system from the outputs of MLP layers improves, in particular for early MLP layers.
These results can be explained by analyzing the
tasks the Transformers are trained on. When the input
data is generated by a fully-observed linear dynamical system, the maximum likelihood estimator of the
∗ corresponds to the leastgroundtruth parameters 𝑊Í

squares solution arg minΦ 𝑡𝑡′−1
=1 2 ∥ 𝑠𝑡 +1 − Φ𝑠𝑡 ∥ . The
mesa-optimizers described in Propositions 1 and 2, as
well as the mesa-layer, can be readily applied to solve
this problem (or a regularized variant, corresponding
to maximum a posteriori estimation under a Gaussian
prior on Φ), as long as inputs and targets are both
encoded within a single token 𝑒𝑡 . This is what we
observe in Fig. 2A.
The nonlinear case can be approached similarly,
by performing least-squares estimation of 𝑊 ∗ after
an appropriate nonlinear feature transformation. For
a Transformer model, the MLP layers are perfectly
placed to implement this transformation. In line with
this, we find that early layers develop a set of basis
functions that align with those of the nonlinear sequence generator, Fig. 2B, followed by a token binding
step (cf. SI Appendix).
We find that there is a longer dependence on the
past under partial observability (Fig. 2A), where nexttoken prediction is complicated due to the presence of
latent variables. This behavior can again be explained
in the light of our mesa-optimization hypothesis. First,
we note that the task our Transformers face is harder
than classical Kalman filtering [40], where knowledge
of groundtruth system parameters is assumed. Methods such as subspace identification [41] or variational
expectation maximization [42] are applicable to this
harder setting, but we found these standard methods difficult to map to a Transformer. We identified
however a less-orthodox algorithm, mathematically
related to data-driven control techniques [43, 44],
which runs online as a sequence is unveiled, and that is
based on least-squares estimation. This algorithm can
therefore be implemented by a Transformer through
Propositions 1 and 2, or by a mesa-layer. The key
step is to encode 𝑘 past observations 𝑠𝑡 − 𝑘+1 , . . . , 𝑠𝑡 in a
single augmented variable 𝑧𝑡 ∈ ℝ𝑘𝑛𝑠 of large enough
dimensionality; it can then be shown that maximum
likelihood estimation of the next token 𝑠𝑡+1 can be
achieved by solving a least-squares problem involving
the augmented variables { 𝑧𝑡 }. We provide a full deriva-

5

We thus conclude that training robustly installs a
token binding mechanism in the first Transformer layers across a range of next-token prediction tasks and
network architectures. Interestingly, this mechanism
exactly coincides with the first layer of the induction
head circuit [4, 5, 8], which has inspired the design
of new neural architectures [45–48]. Through their
analysis of Transformers trained on natural language
modeling, Olsson et al. provide compelling evidence
that the appearance of this mechanism during training is strongly correlated with improvements in incontext learning performance. Here, we interpret this
phenomenon as part of a multi-layer circuit for mesaoptimization. In light of our theory, token binding can
be understood as constructing an in-context training
set of appropriate input-output associations. Once
this step is concluded, the mesa-objective function is
defined, and in-context optimization can take place.
Evidence for mesa-optimizers in linear attentiononly models
We proceed with our analysis of trained Transformers,
focusing in this section on simplified linear-attentiononly architectures, that can in theory be explained
by Propositions 1 and 2. Having shown that a token
binding mechanism can be learned, and aiming for the
simplest deep Transformer setup, in this section we
directly
 feed our
 models with aggregate token inputs,
𝑒𝑡 = 0, 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 −1 , as assumed by our theory. Moreover,
we focus on fully-observable linear tasks.

Figure 4 | Evidence for mesa-optimization in linear selfattention networks. (A) As training proceeds, the test loss
of a single layer of linear self-attention (Linear-SA-1, green
lines) converges to the loss achieved by 1-step gradient descent (Proposition-1, gray line) with optimized learning
rate and initial parameters. A single mesa-layer (red lines)
strongly outperforms a single linear self-attention layer, consistent with the fact that it yields recursively the optimal
(least-squares) solution at every time step. (B) Same analysis, now for a 6-layer linear self-attention model. The increase in the number of attention layers reduces the gap
towards the mesa-layer. The test loss of this model converges to that of the CompressedAlg-6 expression (black
line), which comprises a small fraction (0.5%) of parameters
of the original model, reflecting the highly-structured parameters obtained after training. (C) At convergence, trained
models exhibit the same in-context learning performance
(measured as the loss as a function of sequence length) as
1 step of gradient descent (dashed line). (D) Similarly for
6-layer models, which can be almost perfectly described
by the multi-layer mesa-optimizer of Proposition 2 (dashed
line). (E) Linear probing of next-token targets 𝑠𝑡+1 from the
internal Transformer activations improves with depth and
context length, consistent with mesa-optimization for nexttoken prediction. (F) Linear probing of preconditioned inputs ( 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 + 1/ 𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑠𝑡 improves with depth and context
length, consistent with the mesa-optimizer of Proposition 2.

The results for single-layer networks are strikingly
clear. After next-token prediction training, these networks implement the one-step gradient descent algorithm of Proposition 1 in a near-exact fashion. This can
be seen by visual inspection, Fig. 3, or quantitatively
by comparing the loss reached by the trained layer
with that of a linear autoregressive model learned
through one step of gradient descent, cf. Fig. 4A-C.
We find that we can perfectly fit the outputs of our
trained layer when using all degrees of freedom of our
theory, including not only a learned learning rate 𝜂,
but also a learned set of initial weights Φ0 . Next-token

Notably, we see in Fig. 4 that performance-wise a
deep model with 𝑘 linear attention layers can be almost perfectly explained by 𝑘 steps of the multi-layer
mesa-optimizer described in Proposition 2, with appropriately tuned hyperparameters (cf. Materials and
Methods). Importantly, these hyperparameters are
tuned for maximal 𝑘-step performance and not to reproduce Transformer behavior. This is one additional
point of evidence that our theoretical mesa-optimizers
describe the computations performed by Transformers
trained by next-token prediction error minimization.
Trained softmax self-attention layers behave like
linear attention
We return to standard Transformer models, which feature MLPs, LayerNorm and softmax self-attention layers. We train multi-layer versions of such networks on
fully-observed linear tasks, under a standard tokenization scheme (𝑒𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡 ). Recalling that our theoretical
mesa-optimizers (Propositions 1 and 2) rely on linear
self-attention operations, we now ask whether baseoptimization renders the softmax attention nonlinearity in an approximately linear regime, when driven by
sequences such as those seen during training.

prediction therefore installs in the Transformer an incontext variant of the model-agnostic metalearning
algorithm due to Finn et al. [49].
Deep linear attention networks correspond to highdegree polynomial functions with a large number of
terms. Despite their complexity, for such deep networks training once again leads to highly-structured
sparse model parameters 𝜃; we provide visual examples in the SI Appendix. This allows us to construct an expression (CompressedAlg-𝑑 , where 𝑑 denotes model depth) comprising only 16 parameters
(instead of 3200) per layer head. We find that this compressed, albeit convoluted, expression can describe
a trained deep linear Transformer. In particular, it
allows interpolating between actual Transformer and
CompressedAlg-𝑑 weights (or Proposition 1, for the
single-layer case) in an almost lossless fashion, cf. Figure 4C. Further details can be found in Materials and
Methods.
While the CompressedAlg-𝑑 expression explains a
trained deep linear self-attention model with a small
number of free parameters, it is difficult to interpret
it from the lens of mesa-optimization and connect it
exactly to the theoretical construction of Proposition
2. We therefore resort to a linear probing analysis
[39] to look for signatures of our hypothesized mesaoptimization algorithms. Based on Propositions 1 and
2 we design (i) target probes measuring optimization
progress, regressing 𝑘-th layer representations 𝑒𝑡( 𝑘 )
against the next token 𝑠𝑡+1 to be predicted, where we
could expect multiple steps of gradient descent gradually approaching the target; and (ii) preconditioning probes regressing against preconditioned inputs
( 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 + 1/ 𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑠𝑡 , cf. Materials and Methods. As
shown in Fig. 4D-E we see that both probes succeed,
with linear decoding performance increasing with sequence length and network depth. Base-optimization
has therefore discovered a hybrid algorithm that descends over layers the mesa-objective 𝐿𝑡 ( Φ) while simultaneously improving the condition number of the
mesa-optimization problem. This leads to a fast descent of the mesa-objective.
Examining next-token prediction error, we find that
it decreases quickly with depth, cf. Figure 4C, with a
6-layer model coming close to but still not matching a
single mesa-layer. The high performance of the mesalayer in this setup can be explained by the fact that it
yields the optimal (least-squares) predictor provided
that the correct query, key and value inputs are fed to
it. Moreover, prediction error decreases monotonically
with sequence length both for the mesa-layer as well as
for multi-layer linear Transformers. This improvement
with context size matches the operational definition
of in-context learning proposed by Kaplan et al. [50];
in this sense, the models are strong in-context learners, behaving similarly to regularized least-squares.

(A) The test loss achieved by a linearized Transformer, where
one attention layer at a given depth 𝑑 (intensity color-coded)
is linearized, normalized relative to reference model loss. As
the input dimension 𝑛𝑠 grows, the linear approximation improves for all layers except for the first. The highly-nonlinear
behavior exhibited by this layer is consistent with its special
role in implementing a token binding mechanism (Figs. 1
and 5). (B) The test loss of an autoregressive linear model
learned by regularized least-squares (LSQ, yellow line), the
algorithm we hypothesize that a trained Transformer implements, does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality,

In Fig. 5A, we analyze the test set loss achieved by
a Transformer after replacing a softmax self-attention
layer by its linear counterpart at a given depth, keeping the architecture otherwise intact. We obtain this
control model through a process known as distillation [51]: we first record the outputs produced by
the to-be replaced softmax attention layer, when the

On induction heads
The low linearization error achieved at high enough
data dimension seen in Fig. 5 is at odds with previous
theories explaining in-context learning as best-match
(or nearest neighbor) pattern retrieval, which rely on
the softmax nonlinearity [4, 5]. To better understand
this phenomenon, let us compare the scaling behavior of two competing mechanistic explanations for
in-context learning in Transformers, as we let the input dimension 𝑛𝑠 grow: the theory studied here, where
a linear model is learned by regularized least-squares,
and nonparametric regression under a softmax kernel.
The latter is in fact the algorithm implemented by
the full (two-layer) induction head mechanism [4, 5].
While we have seen previously that the first tokenbinding layer of an induction head circuit is precisely
what Propositions 1 and 2 require, the subsequent
layers differ in the two theories, as we briefly review
next.
In basic terms, an induction head predicts the
next token by first retrieving the most similar past
inputs, and then outputting a similarity-weighted
combination of the tokens that appeared afterwards. This yields the next-token prediction 𝑠ˆ𝑡nn
+1 =
Í𝑡 −1
⊤
′
𝑡 ′ =1 𝑠𝑡 +1 softmax( 𝛽 𝑠𝑡 ′ 𝑠𝑡 ). Unlike least-squares mesaoptimizers, this method operates on the highly nonlinear regime of the softmax attention function, with the
scalar 𝛽 ∈ ℝ+ set large enough so as to approximate
single-pattern retrieval ( 𝛽 → ∞). Thus, with regards
to the linearity of the attention function, an induction
head and the mesa-optimizers studied here sit on two
opposite extremes.
The theory of nonparametric regression has sought
to characterize such interpolants, revealing that generalization error scales in general exponentially with
input dimension [52]. By contrast, it can be shown analytically in the simpler non-autoregressive case that
the generalization error is independent of input dimension for optimally-regularized linear regression
[53, 54], assuming that the task difficulty (measured
as the context size per dimension 𝑇 /𝑛𝑠 ) is conserved,
which is the regime we study here. These theoretical
considerations are reflected in the experiments with

fully-observed linear dynamics reported in Fig. 5B,
where we report the scaling of cumulative next-token
prediction mean-squared error loss for softmax kernel regression with optimally-tuned 𝛽 (per dimension) against an autoregressive linear model learned
by optimally-regularized least-squares (LSQ). We see
that next-token prediction performance is always best
and only weakly depends on 𝑛𝑠 for the latter, whereas
it degrades for the former.
The findings presented in Fig. 5B highlight the merits of performing proper latent variable inference under the correct generative model, over applying a
generic interpolation algorithm. This is the curse of
dimensionality [55], here unveiled at the level of incontext learning. One strategy to deal with this problem is to embed the data in an appropriate learned
space before applying a nearest-neighbor-type method
[56]. For the synthetic autoregressive tasks considered
in this paper, the curse of dimensionality can be defeated if base-optimization discovers the multi-layer
mesa-optimizer of Proposition 2. Below, we provide
further evidence that this actually occurs in trained
Transformers.

Target probe MSE

Transformer is applied to a set of training sequences,
and then train a linear attention layer to reproduce
these outputs by squared error minimization. As we
observe in Fig. 5, for sufficiently large input dimension
𝑛𝑠 , from the second layer onwards the linear attention
models behave as their reference counterparts to a
very good approximation. We further observe that
the first attention layer behaves in an entirely different, nonlinear manner. This is consistent with the fact
that softmax self-attention can implement near-exact
token copying [4], as required by our token binding
mechanism (cf. Figs. 1 and 2).

Mesa-optimization theory describes complete
Transformers
We continue studying complete Transformers, repeating the analyses carried out for deep linear attention
models paired with special input tokens, as required
by Propositions 1 and 2. Moreover, we examine all
three task types — linear systems with either full or

partial observability, as well as nonlinear systems —
now always using conventional input token formatting
(𝑒𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡 ).
In short, our main findings on simplified linear
attention-only models translate to standard Transformers. We have already seen in Fig. 2 that these models
learn appropriate MLP basis functions when faced
with nonlinear tasks, and that they construct internal
training sets by binding tokens together. Repeating
our probing analysis, we now confirm that subsequent
layers execute an algorithm that simultaneously improves next-token predictions and mesa-optimization
conditioning (Fig. 6), as it was the case for linear
attention-only models.
In terms of next-token prediction performance, we
see that 𝑘 steps of Proposition 2 can essentially describe the performance of 𝑘-attention-layer Transformers trained on all three task types considered here
(Figs. 6C and 7), once again in line with our previous findings on simplified linear attention-only models. Moreover, we find that a hybrid two-attentionlayer architecture, stacking one mesa-layer after a
standard softmax attention layer, is the strongest of
all models considered here despite its low parameter
count and shallow depth. This hybrid architecture design is directly inspired by our mesa-optimization the-

Figure 7 | Comparison of the next-token prediction error
of 7-layer softmax Transformers (blue lines) and 2-layer
softmax-mesa Transformers (red lines) on three families of
tasks: fully-observed linear systems (A), partially-observed
linear systems (B), and nonlinear systems (C). To validate
the mesa-optimization theory developed here, we also report
the performance achieved after applying 7 steps of the mesaoptimizer of Proposition 2 to learn the parameters of a linear
model (Proposition-2-linear; yellow lines). For partiallyobserved and nonlinear tasks, we further report the loss
achieved when the Proposition 2 is used to train a linear
model applied to the groundtruth feature transformation,
given by an optimal number of concatenated past tokens
to resolve partial observability, or the MLP∗ ( 𝑠𝑡 ) used by
the nonlinear sequence generator, respectively (Proposition2-nonlinear; light blue lines). These two control models
accurately describe the behavior of actual trained standard
Transformers. Moreover and also in accordance with the
theory developed here, the hybrid-mesa architecture serves
as a strong baseline for all three tasks.

ory, leveraging the fact that softmax attention layers
can easily implement a token binding operation, and
that mesa-layers implement efficient in-context leastsquares solvers. The fact that a fixed-depth, 2-layer
softmax-mesa Transformer provides a performance
upper bound approached as the depth of standard
softmax Transformers increases provides additional
evidence that such models are well described by the
mesa-optimization theory developed here.
Autoregressive Transformers are few-shot learners
Brown et al. [2] established in-context learning in
large autoregressive language models, showing that
LLMs can solve new tasks when provided with a small
number of (‘few-shot’) labeled examples in-context.
Here, we investigate whether a similar phenomenon
occurs in the autoregressive models studied thus far.
To that end, we take the Transformers analyzed above
and present them post-training with in-context linear
regression tasks (cf. Materials and Methods).
Despite the fact that the models were trained to
predict the evolution of linear dynamical systems, and
not to perform supervised in-context learning, we observe that regression loss decreases with sequence
length (Fig. 8A). The models can thus use additional
in-context training data to improve predictions. Our
results therefore show that training Transformers on
simple autoregressive tasks can give rise to in-context
few-shot learning, complementing previous evidence
for this phenomenon in large-scale models [2]. As
a control, we report the performance reached by autoregressive least-squares on the same dataset, which
yields a similar error curve.
We note that the autoregressive in-context learning
algorithm uncovered above is sub-optimal with respect
to linear regression. Close inspection reveals that the
origin of its sub-optimality lies in the learned token
binding mechanism (analyzed in Fig. 2) that binds
every consecutive pair of tokens, in an overlapping
fashion. In a training set of size 𝑛, this introduces 𝑛 − 1
spurious associations, where a regression target 𝑦𝑖 is
incorrectly associated to the next independent input
𝑥 𝑖+1 , whereas only inputs 𝑥 𝑖 should be associated with
their respective targets 𝑦𝑖 . Interestingly, this gives rise
not only to convergence to a sub-optimal solution, but
also to the early ascent phenomenon present in LLMs
[57]. This refers to in-context learning performance
first undergoing a brief but statistically significant period of loss increase, before actual improvements start
taking place. Note that early ascent is not specific to
autoregressive Transformers; we can observe it on the
autoregressive linear least-squares control model as
well (LSQ; Fig. 8A). We therefore identify one cause
for this poorly-understood phenomenon, tracing it
back to the internal mechanics of mesa-optimization
for next-token prediction.

Figure 8 | Autoregressive Transformers display in-context
few-shot learning capabilities. After training a standard 7layer Transformer on autoregressive sequence prediction
problems, we measure its ability to solve linear regression
tasks in-context, without further parameter fine-tuning. The
task training set is presented to the model in sequence, with
each token corresponding either to an input or to its corresponding label. A final test input is provided and the loss
is measured after completing the sequence using the autoregressive Transformer. (A) The mesa-optimizers installed
by autoregressive pretraining can be leveraged off-the-shelf
to solve in-context supervised regression tasks, but yield
sub-optimal regression performance (lightest blue lines).
In-context learning performance can be improved following the standard strategies of prompt (TF+EOS, light blue
lines) and prefix fine-tuning (TF+EOS+P, dark blue lines).
For comparison, we provide the loss achieved by an autoregressive linear model learned by least-squares (LSQ, yellow
lines) (B) Same analysis, now presenting two tasks in a row.
The autoregressive models develop some in-context continual learning capabilities.

To mitigate this effect, we investigate a common
approach, known as prompt-tuning, which can lead
to significant performance improvements when applied to large language models [58, 59]. Concretely, we fine-tune a single token, which we refer to as the EOS token, on the linear regression
objective. When presenting data sequentially as
[ 𝑥1 , 𝑦1 , EOS, 𝑥2 , 𝑦2 , . . . , EOS, 𝑥 𝑁 , 𝑦𝑁 ], where 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖
resp. denote regression inputs and labels, we observe a
considerable performance improvement after prompttuning, see Fig. 8A. Furthermore, to instruct the model
to perform few-shot tasks, we learn a single prefixprompt P which we append at the beginning of a
sequence with EOS tokens. This appears to further
improve the few-shot performance for early data-pairs.
Additional experimental details can be found in Materials and Methods.
Lastly, we demonstrate the capability of autoregressive Transformers to learn multiple tasks in a row. We
study the minimal setup where the model has to learn
two tasks, generated from two distinct groundtruth
linear models, resulting in a sequence of data of the
form [ 𝑥11 , 𝑦11 , . . . , 𝑥 𝑁1 , 𝑦𝑁1 , 𝑥12 , 𝑦12 , . . . , 𝑥 𝑁2 , 𝑦𝑁2 ]. In Fig. 8B,
we see that the trained Transformer can learn a second
task in-context, even though it was never explicitly
trained to solve such sequential learning problems.

Discussion
We’ve presented evidence that Transformer models
develop gradient-based learning algorithms when
trained on sequence prediction tasks under a standard
autoregressive objective. Moreover, we have seen that
the resulting prediction algorithms can be repurposed
without retraining to solve supervised in-context learning tasks, capturing LLM phenomena such as early
ascent or the effectiveness of prompt fine-tuning techniques in improving in-context learning. The fact that
we were able to reproduce these findings in our synthetic data setup is surprising, given that the statespace sequence generators studied here are far from
language models—most notably, they operate in continuous space, and lack deep hierarchical structure.
Our results serve as a case-in-point that autoregressive
Transformers can exhibit in-context learning capabilities outside language modeling, and point towards
the universality of certain properties of these acquired
learning algorithms.
There has been significant debate on whether LLMs,
and learned next-token predictors more generally, are
limited to memorizing correlations present in the training set [having been called stochastic parrots; 61].
This view has been challenged by a number of studies,
analyzing for example autoregressive models trained
to predict legal moves in board games [62–64]. In a
purely observational manner and without any a priori
game knowledge, self-supervised next-token prediction models learn latent representations of the board
state and track the moves of each opponent. Our findings provide complementary evidence that next-token
prediction objectives can lead to the discovery of algorithms that correctly infer the hidden state of the
world: the in-context learning algorithm we identified
can be precisely cast as maximum a posteriori inference under the correct Bayesian prior and likelihood
function. Moreover, the multi-layer mesa-optimizers
installed by next-token prediction objectives are highly
efficient (i.e., achieve significant loss reduction in only
a few layers) thanks to precise tuning of their hyperparameters to the sequence generative model.
The idea that a Transformer generates its predictions by solving internal optimization problems has
ties to many different lines of thought in machine
learning. One closely related line of work explores the
concept of a declarative node: a differentiable layer
whose output is defined implicitly as the solution of an
optimization problem [65–67]. We note that subsum-

10

Uncovering mesa-optimization algorithms in Transformers

ing an entire chain of layers by a single declarative
node is not only potentially more efficient, but also
more interpretable. The mesa-layer is an example
of such a node, adding to recent studies exploring
the advantages of including declarative nodes within
attention-based models [38, 68–70].
Our analysis of trained models revealed that stochastic gradient descent in effect discovered a declarative
node, preferring to pick an optimization algorithm
among alternative solutions in the configuration space
of autoregressive Transformers. This can be partly
explained by the fact that recursive least-squares can
be leveraged to solve the tasks considered here, and
by the fact that Transformers can efficiently approximate this algorithm through Proposition 2. Our results complement the theoretical work of Hubinger
et al. [27], by providing a concrete toy model where
mesa-optimization occurs. However, more work is
still needed to characterize this phenomenon outside
the controlled experimental setting considered in this
paper.
The mesa-layer developed here can also be seen
as a locally optimal fast weight programmer [29]. In
his seminal work [29], Schimidhuber proposed to dynamically reprogram the weights of a feedforward
neural network using a Hebbian rule. As pointed out
by Schlag et al. [33], this is precisely what a linear selfattention layer does: it generates predictions using an
effective weight matrix that is learned by taking outer
products of values and keys, a Hebbian associative
rule [71]. In this work, we instead frame fast weight
learning as an optimization problem that is efficiently
solved at every moment in time by the mesa-layer.
This form of optimal fast learning is strictly superior
to Hebb’s rule, both in terms of generalization and
memory capacity [72]. The mesa-layer is therefore
also closely related to the Delta-Net [33], which uses
the delta rule [73] for fast weight learning. Unlike the
mesa-layer, which is optimal at every step, the delta
rule requires multiple steps to converge, though it is
cheaper to implement. The strong performance of the
mesa-layer observed here on synthetic tasks suggests
investigating its application to natural data at larger
scales, for which we provide preliminary language
modeling results in Appendix G.
Our work has an unexpected connection to research
on local learning rules, a question of great interest in
theoretical neuroscience [74]. Decomposing a global
learning problem into a series of local quadratic optimization problems, like the objective functions of the
mesa-optimizers studied here, is at the heart of the
target propagation [75], predictive coding [76] and
control-based [77] theories of learning in the brain.
Moreover, previous studies have proposed greedy layerwise learning algorithms that do not require global
error information [78–82]. Much in the same vein

but now on the fast timescale of inference, the mesaoptimizers uncovered here implement greedy, local
learning algorithms which only use bottom-up information.
We conclude by discussing our findings in the light
of predictive processing theories of intelligence, where
learning predictive models is presumed to underwrite
intelligent behavior [83, 84]. A number of influential
predictive processing models have adopted a Bayesian
approach, starting from the assumption that the world
obeys a certain generative model, and then handdesigning approximate inference algorithms for the
assumed model [85–89]. Here, directly inspired by
LLMs, we took a powerful neural sequence model and
trained it to maximize the likelihood of upcoming
inputs given the past, without making explicit probabilistic assumptions about the latent structure of the
world. The network was nonetheless able to discover
the correct underlying model of the data, and appropriately exploit its knowledge to generate predictions.
This finding provides further evidence that direct maximization of future prediction performance by simple
gradient-based methods — as opposed to hierarchical
probabilistic methods, and the typically intractable
inference problems that they bring — might be sufficient to build the predictive processing backbone of
an intelligent system.

Methods
Transformer architectures
The Transformer models studied here follow the
widely-used GPT-2 specification [90]. This architecture comprises multiple identical blocks, with one
block consisting of the softmax self-attention layer
defined in equation 2 followed by a one-hidden layer
MLP. The inputs of both layers are normalized:
𝑒𝑡 ← 𝑒𝑡 + Δ𝑒sa
𝑡 (LN( 𝑒𝑡 ))
mlp

𝑒𝑡 ← 𝑒𝑡 + Δ𝑒𝑡

(LN( 𝑒𝑡 )) ,

where LN(·) denotes the LayerNorm operation [28],
mlp
and Δ𝑒𝑡 ( 𝑒𝑡 ) = 𝑊2 GELU(𝑊1 𝑒) with GELU( 𝑒) := 𝑒 G( 𝑒),
and G(·) the Gaussian cumulative distribution function, applied elementwise [91]. We set 𝑊1 such that
𝑊1 𝑒 has four times more neurons compared to 𝑒, which
itself is four times larger than 𝑠. Additional architectural details are provided in the SI Appendix.
The predictions are read-out directly from the first
dimensions of last-layer token outputs, and we add
a positional encoding to every input following the
original method of Vaswani et al. [3]. If not explicitly stated otherwise, for models that incorporate the
mesa-layer, we leave the architecture configuration

generate observations by letting a groundtruth system
evolve according to
ℎ𝑡+1 = 𝑊 ∗ 𝑓 ∗ ( ℎ𝑡 ) + 𝜖ℎ,𝑡
𝑠𝑡 = 𝐶 ∗ ℎ𝑡 + 𝜖𝑠,𝑡 ,

where 𝜖ℎ,𝑡 ∼ N (0, 𝜎ℎ2 ) is a noise input and 𝜖𝑠,𝑡 ∼
N (0, 𝜎2𝑠 ) is an observation noise term. We set the
transition matrix 𝑊 ∗ ∈ ℝ𝑛ℎ × 𝑛ℎ to a random orthogonal
matrix, and we consider both fully-observed (𝐶 ∗ = 𝐼 )
and partially-observed tasks, where 𝑛𝑠 < 𝑛ℎ , and 𝐶 𝑖∗𝑗 ∼
N (0, 0.5). Our tasks can be further categorized as linear (by setting 𝑓 ∗ to the identity function) or nonlinear. For the nonlinear case, we always take 𝐶 ∗ = 𝐼 and
introduce a nonlinear transformation MLP∗ (·) in statespace, ℎ𝑡+1 = 𝑊 ∗ MLP∗ ( ℎ𝑡 ) + 𝜖𝑡 . The MLP computation
is described by MLP∗ ( ℎ𝑡 ) = 𝐵 · GELU( 𝐴 · ℎ𝑡 ), where
𝐴 ∈ ℝ𝑛𝑚 × 𝑛ℎ ∼ N (0, 1.1) and 𝐵 ∈ ℝ𝑛ℎ × 𝑛𝑚 ∼ N (0, 1.1).
Importantly, we draw new transition and readout
matrices 𝑊 ∗ and 𝐶 ∗ for every sequence. These parameters are analogous to task-specific variables in multitask learning [93], adapted to the problem of unsupervised sequence modeling. We introduce sequencespecific variables to reflect the high degree of variability that is observed in large datasets of real-world
data, such as in LLM training corpora [90]. Under
such a generative model, rote memorization solutions
are excluded from the global minimizers of Eq. 1: a
trained Transformer cannot achieve minimal loss by
memorizing a single set of 𝑊 ∗ and 𝐶 ∗ in its parameters
𝜃. Instead, it must deal with inherent uncertainty in
every sequence, and infer in-context a set of latent variables whose values vary from sequence to sequence.
The main goal of this paper is to characterize this
in-context inference process.

Adding the above result to the layer input, an operation that is supported in Transformers by a residual
connection or a second attention head, yields the desired output.
Full statement and proof of Proposition 2
We present here the linear self-attention parameter
construction which supports the claim of Proposition 2.
First, we restate the goal of the autoregressive Transformer, namely, to solve a regularized least-squares
problem:

for all time steps simultaneously. This amounts to
computing a (recursive) least squares solution, where
time-shifted (by one) sequence elements play the role
of inputs and desired outputs in a dataset, with inputs
𝑆𝑡 −1 , targets 𝑆𝑡 , and test input 𝑠𝑡 .
With the limited expressivity of one layer, we have
already established that Transformers can, and do,
implement a single gradient step on the correspondÍ

parallel both in theory and in practice. The key observation here is that given a preconditioning matrix 𝐻𝑡∗ = ( 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 which changes the loss
Í
∗ ′ 2
′
to 𝑡𝑡′−1
=1 ∥ 𝑠𝑡 +1 − Φ𝐻𝑡 𝑠𝑡 ∥ , a single gradient descent
step immediately yields the desired regularized leastsquares solution.
Based on this simple observation, we provide a theoretical construction that shows how Transformers can
approximate ( 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑠𝑡 layer by layer in their

forward pass, leading to improved single-step gradient descent performance. Note that this is equivalent
to iteratively solving the systems of linear equations
{(𝑆𝑡′ −1 𝑆𝑡⊤′ −1 + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) 𝑥 = 𝑠𝑡′ }𝑡𝑡′ =1 . Let us now approximate
the above expression with a truncated Neumann series:

) 𝐼 − 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 )˜𝑠𝑡𝐾 = 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 + 𝐻

˜𝑡∗ := ((1 − 1𝜆 ) 𝐼 − 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆⊤ ). This corresponds to
with 𝐻
𝑡 −1
the Richardson iteration [94] method for solving linear systems iteratively, which can be augmented with
a stepwise parameter (or learning rate) 𝛼 𝐾 and an
additional term adding the difference between former
approximations, resembling a momentum term. This
variant is termed second-order Richardson or Chebyshev [95] iteration, and it can speed up convergence:
˜𝑡∗ 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 − 𝛽 𝐾 (˜𝑠𝑡𝐾 − 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 −1 ) .
𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 +1 = 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 − 𝛼 𝐾 𝐻

(9)

We now show that a single step of these iteration
methods can be mapped to a single layer of linear
self-attention, allowing deep Transformers to solve
the aforementioned set of linear equations efficiently
in parallel. Starting with a token construction similar to the one
of Proposition
1, i.e., with aggre

gate tokens 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾′ , 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾′ −1 , 𝑠𝑡′ −1 with 𝑠˜𝑡0 = 𝑠𝑡 , we can compute 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 +1 with a single causally masked linear selfattention, in parallel for ∀𝑡 . Indeed, with 𝑊𝑘⊤𝑊𝑞 =

products needed to compute equation 9 can be computed inside a single linear self-attention layer in parallel, for all time steps. The remaining terms in equation 9 are simple scaled additions of 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 , 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 +1 for which
multiple alternative constructions exist. Note that for
the construction above to hold, we need to have 𝑠𝑡 −1
available at every layer and push forward 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 such that
it can be used to compute (˜𝑠𝑡𝐾 +1 − 𝑠˜𝑡𝐾 ) in the next iteration which again is easy to accomplish within the
residual stream.
We therefore conclude that deep Transformer models can approximate the solutions of the set of systems of linear equations {(𝑆𝑡′ −1 𝑆𝑡⊤′ −1 + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) 𝑥 = 𝑠𝑡 }𝑡𝑡′ =1

efficiently in parallel. This results in a precondiÍ′

tioning of the least-squares problems { 𝑡𝑡′′−1

Φ𝐻𝑡∗′ 𝑠𝑡′′ ∥ 2 }𝑡𝑡′ =1 , which can then be solved with a single
gradient step, again in parallel and by a single additional linear self-attention layer, built after Proposition
1.
Mesa-optimizers solve partially-observed linear
tasks
We now show that Propositions 1 and 2 can be leveraged to solve next-token prediction problems involving
linear latent variable dynamics, as in our experiments
with partially-observed linear dynamical systems. We
analyze here the deterministic setting, i.e., when no
noise is added to the state transitions and observations; for an extension to the stochastic case, see the
SI Appendix. We investigate a simple construction
where we concatenate the last 𝑘 observations into a
single ‘state’ vector 𝑧, and use this state vector in a
least-squares problem to estimate the linear transition
between 𝑧𝑡+1 and 𝑧𝑡 . As 𝑧𝑡+1 contains 𝑠𝑡+1 , this state
prediction can be used straight-forwardly to predict
the next observation. Let us define
𝑠𝑡 − 𝑘+1 


.. 
.
 . 
 𝑠𝑡 




𝑧𝑡𝑘 = 

We first investigate whether the transition between 𝑧𝑡𝑘
and 𝑧𝑡𝑘+1 is a linear operator. For this, let us define the
observation matrix as
 𝐶∗ 
 ∗ ∗ 
 𝐶 𝑊 


O𝑘 = 
.
..


.


𝐶 ∗𝑊 ∗ 𝑘 −1 


Now we have that 𝑧𝑡𝑘 = O𝑘 ℎ𝑡 − 𝑘+1 and 𝑧𝑡𝑘+1 =
O𝑘𝑊 ∗ ℎ𝑡 − 𝑘+1 . We want to find a matrix Φ𝑘 such that
𝑧𝑡𝑘+1 = Φ𝑘 𝑧𝑡𝑘 . As this should hold for all possible system initializations and hence ℎ𝑡 − 𝑘+1 , we have that
O𝑘𝑊 ∗ = Φ𝑘 O𝑘 . If 𝑘𝑛𝑠 ≥ 𝑛ℎ , we have an underdetermined or fully-determined (in case of equality) set of
linear equations, assuming no rank-deficient matrices.
The minimum-norm solution for Φ𝑘 is given by
Φ𝑘 = O𝑘𝑊 ∗ O𝑘† ,

with O𝑘† the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of O𝑘 . If
the dimension of the concatenated observations 𝑧 𝑘 is
smaller than the dimension of the groundtruth state
ℎ (𝑘𝑛𝑠 < 𝑛ℎ ), the linear system is overdetermined
and in general there does not exist a solution for Φ𝑘 .
Hence, in order to do optimal predictions, we need
to concatenate enough observations into 𝑧𝑡𝑘 such that
𝑘𝑛𝑠 ≥ 𝑛ℎ .

13

Uncovering mesa-optimization algorithms in Transformers

As there exists a linear map between 𝑧𝑡𝑘+1 and 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ,
and 𝑧𝑡𝑘+1 can be used directly to predict 𝑠𝑡+1 , a Transformer can solve the least-squares problem in-context
on 𝑧𝑡𝑘+1 . One possible implementation is the following
construction: (i) copy the last 𝑘 observations into a
concatenated state vector 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ; (ii) format tokens as required by Propositions 1 and 2, now with 𝑧𝑡𝑘 instead
of ℎ𝑡 , which can be done by the same self-attention
layer as the first step; (iii) solve the mesa-optimization
problem by directly leveraging the aforementioned
propositions.
CompressedAlg-𝑑
After training a single- or multi-layer linear attention model, we obtain structured matrix products
𝑊𝐾⊤𝑊𝑄 , 𝑃𝑊𝑣 per head and layer. When inspecting the
trained weight matrix products, we observe strong
block-diagonal structure across all layers. We extract
the mean values of these block-diagonals and construct sparse weight matrices, consisting only of identity sub-matrices scaled by the resp. obtained mean
value, and compute the evaluation of this constructed
compressed algorithm on test sequences. Then, during a second training run (for the same initial conditions), we compute the test loss achieved by an a
control model with interpolated parameters, obtained
by averaging (with equal averaging weight) the compressed per-head weight-matrix-products and the actual trained layer parameters.
Probing analyses
In Figs. 2, 4 and 6 we show the performance of linear
decoders trained to predict certain features (e.g., a
given past input token 𝑒𝑡′ , in Fig. 2A) from internal
model activations at various depths, time steps, and
stages of training. For every such probing experiment
(i.e., for each layer, context length, or base training
step, depending on the analysis at hand) we train a
separate linear decoder on a batch of activations to predict the respective probing targets by mean-squared
error minimization (linear regression). For the preconditioning probings, we compute the 6-step Chebyshev
approximation of (𝑆𝑡′ −1 𝑆𝑡⊤′ −1 + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) 𝑠𝑡′ at each time step
𝑡 ′ , and linearly regress the activations after each layer
at the respective time step against this preconditioning
target.
In-context few-shot learning: generative model
To generate a few-shot task, we sample a groundtruth
𝑊 ∗ random orthogonal matrix as done during training, but now use this groundtruth model to generate a labeled training set { 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖 } 𝑖𝑁=1 , with inputs
𝑥 𝑖 ∼ N (0, 𝐼 𝑥 ) and targets 𝑦𝑖 = 𝑊 ∗ 𝑥 𝑖 . We then present
this dataset to our autoregressive Transformers as a
sequence of tokens, 𝑒few-shot = [ 𝑥1 , 𝑦1 , . . . , 𝑥 𝑁 , 𝑦𝑁 ] of

length 𝑇 = 2 𝑁 , cf. Figure 8. As the sequence unfolds, and more training data is presented, we measure in-context learning performance through the
mean squared error between the Transformer output 𝑓𝜃 ( 𝑒2𝑖 −1 ; 𝑒few-shot
) and the corresponding target
1:2𝑖 −1
𝑦𝑖 = 𝑒2𝑖 . We emphasize that both the sequence generative model and loss function differ from the ones used
during training; compare the task performance metÍ
ric 𝐿few-shot = 12 𝑖𝑁=1 ∥ 𝑒2𝑖 − 𝑓𝜃 ( 𝑒2𝑖 −1 ; 𝑒few-shot
) ∥ 2 used to
1:2𝑖 −1
evaluate in-context learning performance in this section with the actual loss used to train the Transformer,
Eq. 1.
As a control, we further report the performance
reached by the least-squares solution (LSQ) obtained
on the dataset 𝐷mesa
= {( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖 )} 𝑖𝑁=1 ∪ {( 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑖+1 )} 𝑖𝑁=1−1 ,
𝑁
and observe a similar decrease in loss after a phase
of early ascent. This dataset, where half of the associspurious
ations consist of wrong input-output pairs 𝐷𝑁
=
{( 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑖+1 )} 𝑖𝑁=1−1 as illustrated in Figure 8A, corresponds
to the training set an autoregressive Transformer imbued with the mesa-optimizers uncovered in the previous section learns from.

Figure 9 | Weights of the deep 6-layer linear Transformer trained on constructed tokens 𝑒𝑡 = (0, 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 −1 ). We
observe clear structure in the trained Transformer weight products 𝑊𝐾⊤𝑊𝑄 as well as 𝑃𝑊𝑉 in all 4 heads. Note that this
structure seems to be sufficient to approximate ( 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 + 1/ 𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑠𝑡 , cf. probing experiments and weight construction in
the main text. We show here all 4 heads (f.l.t.r.) of the first (top 2 rows), the second (next 2 rows), and the fourth (last 2
rows) linear layer.

Figure 10 | Weight products of the deep 7-layer softmax Transformers trained on unconstructed tokens 𝑒𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡 . We
observe diagonal structure in the trained Transformer weight products 𝑊𝐾⊤𝑊𝑄 as well as 𝑃𝑊𝑉 . Note that this structure seems
to be sufficient to approximate layer-wise the final prediction 𝑠𝑡+1 as well as ( 𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 + 1/ 𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑠𝑡 , cf. probing experiments
and weight construction in the main text. We show here all 4 heads (f.l.t.r.) of the first (top 2 rows) the second (middle 2
rows) and the fourth (last 2 rows) layers after the first (potential) copying-softmax-layer.

B. Additional details on the mesa-layer
In this section, we provide a detailed derivation of the forward and backward (reverse-mode differentiation)
pass of the mesa-layer. For completeness, we consider a generalized version of the mesa-layer, which includes
an additional forget factor Γℎ,𝑡 = ( 𝛾ℎ,𝑡′ )𝑡𝑡′ =1 , where 𝛾ℎ,𝑡′ ∈ (0, 1], inspired by the recursive least-squares with
forget factor algorithm [96]. Given again a set of tokens 𝐸𝑡 , the generalized mesa-layer changes the tokens as

take the key 𝐾ℎ ∈ ℝ 𝐷𝑎 ×𝑇 and value matrices 𝑉ℎ ∈ R 𝐷𝑎 ×𝑇 with all the sequence timesteps and select the entries
occurring before time 𝑡 . The main difference with the usual causal mask ( 1𝑡′ ≤ 𝑡 )𝑡′ ,𝑡 is the inclusion of the forget
factors. It can be efficiently computed leveraging partial products. We conclude by remarking that the same
mask can be applied to softmax attention layers, applying it to the key-queries products before the softmax.

time, and computes the backward pass in a similar time and memory complexity as for the forward pass. The
derivation is identical without forgetting factors, by setting all 𝛾 to 1.
Comment on runtime. We highlight that, although this implementation of the mesa-layer reduces the
memory footprint of the forward and backward pass substantially, the layer still runs forward (and backward)
in time. This prevents the computation of all mesa-layer outputs in parallelization during training, a crucial
advantage of softmax as well as linear attention. On the other hand, during test time, the mesa-layer benefits
from the same advantages of linear self-attention or RNNs and predicts the next token without the necessity to
store and attend to the past. In the next sections, we present two potential avenue to improve the training time
by a solution based in linear solvers or by a solution approximating the necessary inversions by a Neumann
series running in parallel.
C.2. Alternative derivation through the implicit function theorem
We here present an alternative way of deriving the gradients presented above that leverages the implicit function
theorem. The key here is to remark that Φ̂𝑡mesa satisfies that the gradient of the least-square regression loss

25

𝐿 is 0. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the case in which the output dimension of Φ̂𝑡mesa is one, that is
ˆ𝑡⊤ for 𝜙ˆ𝑡 some column vector, and remark that we have to repeat the same operation over all rows
Φ̂𝑡mesa = 𝜙

to obtain the full gradient, as all output coordinates are independent in the least-square regression
problem. Therefore, we 𝑤 defined through the implicit function

Finally, we can recover the desired gradient by combining the previous equation with the chain rule.
C.3. Parallel backward pass through Neumann series approximation
Although the previous custom backward gradient computation allows for dramatic memory savings during
training, the underlying recursive least squares computation still suffers from linear scaling in time, similar to
recurrent neural networks, as we cannot parallelize computation across time dimension.
Here, we discuss an alternative forward pass that can be used when one can afford storing all intermediate
matrices 𝑅ℎ,𝑡 in time. This forward pass leverages a 𝐾 -step truncated Neumann series to approximate the
inverses in parallel, and is compatible with automatic differentiation tools out of the box. Interestingly, we can
do this by simply repeating (with the same weights) a slightly altered linear self-attention layer 𝐾 times.
Our goal is now to efficiently compute the terms 𝑞˜𝑡 := 𝑅𝑡 𝑞𝑡 = ( 𝐾𝑡 𝐾𝑡⊤ + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑞𝑡 for all time steps in parallel.
Indeed, once give these vectors, one can leverage Equation 20 and efficient dot-product attention (DPA) layers
implementations1 . Note that we here ignore the forgetting factors, but their partial products can easily be
integrated in one of the 𝐾𝑡 in 𝐾𝑡 𝐾𝑡⊤ to recover the version with forget rates described above.
Given an invertible matrix 𝑋 with operator norm less than 1, the truncated Neumann series approximates its
inverse by

(46)

An advantage of the truncated Neumann series compared to other approximate inverse techniques such as
Newton-Iteration is that we can compute more series elements without passing intermediate matrices across
algorithmic steps – which in turn makes it memory efficient and straightforward to use in the light of automatic

differentiation. We only need to keep the original matrix we wish to invert in memory at all times and store the
intermediate vectors 𝑥˜ ( 𝑘 ) for the backward pass.
We now look at the quantities we wish to compute, that is 𝑞˜𝑡 = ( 𝐾𝑡 𝐾𝑡⊤ + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑞𝑡 , and approximate it by
(𝐾)
𝑞˜𝑡 , obtained by multiplying 𝑞𝑡 to the 𝐾 -step truncated Neumann series approximating the inverse term
( 𝐾𝑡 𝐾𝑡⊤ + 1𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 . Note that a normalization by the operator norm of the matrix inside the inverse is necessary for
the approximation to hold.

After obtaining 𝑄

Equation 49 by simply pre-computing these terms before running the Neumann approximation. We nevertheless
observe the former version to be faster when timing for forward and backward computation and speculate the
reason being the highly optimized implementation of DPA as the backbone of the self-attention layer. Note that
a simple byproduct of the derivations here is the insight that chaining linear self-attention layers can actually
easily implement truncated Neumann series computation – especially if the goal is an inverse multiplied by a
known vector. See materials and methods section of the main text for an in-depth analysis.

D. Probabilistic latent-state inference in Transformers
In this section, we generalize our results on latent-state inference in partially-observed deterministic linear
systems towards noisy linear systems. Our aim is to show that the optimal maximum-likelihood estimator
(MLE) of the next observation 𝑠𝑡+1 is a linear map of the concatenated previous observations, possibly encoded
into a lower-dimensional subspace by a linear encoder. First, we show that in the Gaussian noise setting, the
MLE of 𝑠𝑡+1 is a linear map of the MLE of the latent state ℎ𝑡+1 . Second, we show that the MLE of the latent
state ℎ𝑡+1 is a linear map of a concatenation of the previous 𝑘 observations. Finally, we generalize our setting to
allow for a linear encoding of all the previous observations into a fixed low-dimensional subspace, instead of
explicitly concatenating 𝑘 observations. Taken together, these results show that performing least-squares linear
regression on tokens that encode or concatenate previous observations is an optimal strategy for predicting the
next observation according to the maximum-likelihood estimator.
D.1. The MLE of 𝑠𝑡+1 is a linear map of the MLE of ℎ𝑡+1
As we consider linear dynamics with additive Gaussian noise, the distributions 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ) and 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 , ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 )
are multivariate Gaussians. Let us now consider the MLE estimators of the marginal 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ) and joint
distribution 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 , ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ).
marginal

𝑠ˆ𝑡+1

= arg max 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 )

𝑠ˆ𝑡+1 , ℎˆ𝑡+1 = arg max 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ) 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑠𝑡+1 , 𝑧𝑡𝑘 )
𝑠𝑡+1 ,ℎ𝑡+1

𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑠𝑡+1 , 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ) is Gaussian, as conditional distributions of jointly distributed Gaussian variables are also

Gaussian. Furthermore, the covariance of a Gaussian conditional distribution only depends on the covariance of
the joint distribution, not on the specific value of the conditioned variable 𝑠𝑡+1 . Hence, the maximum (not the
marginal
joint
arg max) of 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑠𝑡+1 , 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ) is independent from 𝑠𝑡+1 , and we hence have that the MLE 𝑠ˆ𝑡+1
is equal to 𝑠ˆ𝑡+1 .
𝑘
𝑘
Rewriting the joint distribution as 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | ℎ𝑡+1 , 𝑧𝑡 ), and repeating the same arguments, we have that
marginal

the MLE of 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ). Hence, the MLE of 𝑠𝑡+1 is a linear map of the MLE of the latent state ℎ𝑡+1 .

D.2. The MLE of ℎ𝑡+1 is a linear map of 𝑧𝑡𝑘
Now we turn our focus on showing that ℎˆMLE
= arg maxℎ𝑡+1 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ) as a linear map of 𝑧𝑡𝑘 . First, by similar
𝑡 +1
MLE
MLE
arguments as before, we have that ℎˆ𝑡+1 = 𝐴ℎˆ𝑡 , with ℎˆMLE
= arg max 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡 | 𝑧𝑡𝑘 ). In the following, we show

that ℎˆMLE
is a linear map of 𝑧𝑡𝑘 , thereby completing our goal of this section.

Uncovering mesa-optimization algorithms in Transformers

Now we want to extract the maximum-likelihood estimate of ℎ𝑡 . We have that
𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡 , 𝑣𝑡𝑘 , 𝜖ℎ,𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 −1 | 𝑠𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 ) = 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡 | 𝑠𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑣𝑡𝑘 , 𝜖ℎ,𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 −1 | ℎ𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 )

(53)

Importantly, all variables are Gaussian, as we have linear dynamics and Gaussian noise. Due to the property of
Gaussian conditional distribution conditioned before,
the maximum of 𝑝 ( 𝑣𝑡𝑘 , 𝜖ℎ,𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 −1 | ℎ𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 ) only depends on the covariance matrix of the distribution
and hence does not depend on the value of ℎ𝑡 . Consequently, we have that the value of ℎ𝑡 that maximizes
𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡 , 𝑣𝑡𝑘 , 𝜖ℎ,𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 −1 | 𝑠𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 ) is the same one that maximizes 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡 | 𝑠𝑡 − ( 𝑘 −1):𝑡 ). This is convenient, as it is
much more tractable to maximize the joint distribution w.r.t. ℎ𝑡 and the noise variables, compared to maximizing
the marginal distribution w.r.t. ℎ𝑡 , for which we need to compute integrals.
As the noise variables are Gaussian (with covariances which we assume to be equal to 𝜎𝐼 for simplicity),
maximizing the joint log-probability is equivalent to the following optimization problem:

As there exists an optimal map between 𝑧𝑡𝑘 and 𝑧𝑡𝑘+1 that is linear, this map can be found by performing
least-squares on an autoregressive dataset with 𝑧𝑡𝑘 .
D.3. Capacity constraints on the representation
Previously, we derived results for a fixed 𝑘. Now, we consider the case with a capacity bottleneck on the
representations of the transformer. Let us assume that the transformer can allocate a 𝑑 -dimensional subspace
to store some representation of the past observations 𝑠0:𝑡 −1 . Instead of concatenating 𝑘 previous observations
into this subspace with the constraint that 𝑘 ≤ 𝑑 /𝑛𝑠 with 𝑛𝑠 the observation dimension, we can consider a
more general case where we have an encoding 𝑢𝑡 = 𝐸𝑠0:𝑡 = 𝐸𝑧𝑇𝑡 . Here, 𝐸 ∈ ℝ𝑑 ×𝑇𝑛𝑠 , with 𝑇 the sequence length.
For 𝑡 < 𝑇 , we prepend zeros to 𝑠0:𝑡 to make the dimensions fit. When 𝐸 consists of identity matrices on the
diagonals corresponding to the 𝑘 last observations, we recover the previous case. However, it might be more
optimal to copy partial information from more than 𝑘 observations, resulting in a different encoding matrix 𝐸.
We are interested in three main points. First, we need to formalize a bottleneck objective that the encoding
matrix 𝐸 should optimize. Second, we need to show that the MLE for 𝑠𝑡 is still a linear map of the encoded
observations 𝑢𝑡 . Finally, we need some algorithm or strategy to compute the optimal encoding matrix 𝐸, such
that we can compare it to the learned weights of the transformer.
Bottleneck objective. We want the encoding to capture as much useful information about past observations
as possible, to predict the future observation. Hence, we want the MLE 𝑦ˆ𝑡+1 conditioned on 𝑢𝑡 to be as close as
possible to the MLE conditioned on the full past 𝑦0:𝑡 . We can formalize this in the following bilevel optimization
problem
min || arg max 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑠0:𝑡 ) − arg max 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑢𝑡 )|| 2
𝐸

𝑠𝑡+1

(64)

𝑠𝑡+1

As both 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑠0:𝑡 ) and 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑢𝑡 ) are Gaussian, we have that the MLE of 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 | 𝑠0:𝑡 ) and 𝑝 ( 𝑠𝑡+1 , ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑠0:𝑡 ) are
the same (see previous section), and hence we can rewrite the bilevel optimization problem into an equivalent
form:
"
#
min || 𝐶 arg max 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑠0:𝑡 ) − arg max 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑢𝑡 ) || 2
𝐸

ℎ𝑡+1

(65)

ℎ𝑡+1

MLE of ℎ𝑡+1 is a linear map of 𝑢𝑡 . For a fixed encoding 𝐸, it is easy to see that the MLE ℎˆ𝑡+1 , and hence the
MLE 𝑠ˆ𝑡+1 = 𝐶 ℎˆ𝑡+1 as well, are a linear map of 𝑢𝑡 . We have that 𝑢𝑡 = 𝐸𝑧𝑇𝑡 . Hence,
we can repeat
the calculations of

Í −1
the previous section, now with a new linear constraint 𝑢𝑡 = 𝐸 𝑣𝑇𝑡 + F𝑇 ℎ𝑡 − 𝑇𝑙=1
F𝑇𝑙 𝜖ℎ,𝑡 − 𝑙 for the MLE objective
equation 54. The main result that the MLE ℎˆ𝑡+1 is a linear map of 𝑢𝑡 holds in this case as well, as all equations
for the first-order optimality conditions remain linear.
How to compute the optimal encoding? Now that we derived arg maxℎ𝑡+1 𝑝 ( ℎ𝑡+1 | 𝑢𝑡 ) as a function of 𝐸, we
can use this to optimize the encoding objective equation 65 w.r.t. 𝐸, by computing its gradients. Concretely, we
need to iterate the following two steps:
1. Compute the MLE 𝑠ˆ𝑡 = 𝐶 ∗ ℎˆ𝑡 conditioned on 𝑢𝑡 , by solving the
system
 resulting from the MLE objective
Í linear
−1 𝑙
equation 54 with the new constraint 𝑢𝑡 = 𝐸 𝑣𝑇𝑡 + F𝑇 ℎ𝑡 − 𝑇𝑙=1
F𝑇 𝜖ℎ,𝑡 − 𝑙 . Use a differentiable linear solver
(e.g. torch.linalg.solve), such that we can backpropagate through it in step 2.
2. Compute the encoding loss equation 65 and compute the gradients w.r.t. 𝐸 on a training dataset consisting
of multiple teacher systems.

For our main text experiments, the groundtruth transition matrix 𝑊 ∗ was set to a random orthogonal matrix.
Here we briefly analyze Transformers trained on systems with different transition matrix statistics. For all
settings in this section, we assume full observability, that is 𝑠𝑡 = ℎ𝑡 for all time steps 𝑡 .

E.1. Contracting linear dynamics
We show here the preliminary result when diverging from purely orthogonal teachers 𝑊 to construct the
sequence presented to the Transformer and restrict the eigenvalues of 𝑊 ∼ N (0, 𝐼 ) in a band of [0.3, 0.9]. We
notice that with these 𝑊 approximately 2% of the sequences lead to very large values. To ease trainability, we
therefore clip all the values of those sequences to values between [−2, 2].
When training a single layer of linear self-attention, see Figure 11, we again observe that the trained layer
matches the performance of a single step of gradient descent. We furthermore find clean weight structure,
comparable to the weights trained on sequences which are generated by an orthogonal teacher, see Figure 13.
For multi-layer linear transformers we find both gradually increasing probing of preconditioned inputs
as necessary for our hypothesis, Proposition 2, as well as gradual performance improvement for deeper
Transformers.

Figure 11 | Evidence for mesa-optimization in Transformers trained on contracting linear dynamics. (A) At convergence,
models trained on contracting sequences exhibit the same in-context learning performance (measured as the loss as a
function of sequence length) as 1 step of gradient descent (dashed line), as in our findings for models trained on data
generated by an orthogonal teacher. (B) In six-layer linear self-attention models trained on constructed tokens, we find
that linear probing of preconditioned inputs (𝑆𝑡 −1 𝑆𝑡⊤−1 + 1/ 𝜆 𝐼 ) −1 𝑠𝑡 improves with depth and context length, consistent
with the mesa-optimizer of Proposition 2 and our findings for the orthogonal-teacher setting. (C) For deeper models,
performance in this setting increases. We find that the mesa-layer outperforms any other model and that a six-layer linear
self-attention model can be explained by Proposition 2. (D) We again find highly structured weights that, in the shown
two-head-one-layer case, can implement an update step of gradient descent.

E.2. Fixed-teacher linear dynamics
Here we analyse the setting where every sequence shares the same single fixed orthogonal transition matrix
𝑊 ∗ ∈ ℝ𝑛ℎ × 𝑛ℎ , and only the initial state ℎ1 ∼ N (0, 1) is sequence-specific. Thus, in this setting there is no need
to infer 𝑊 ∗ in-context.
We report the results for the experiments in Figure 12. We observe that for this case even a one-layer linear
self-attention Transformer drastically outperforms an update step of gradient descent. Furthermore, we find no
evidence for the mesa-optimizers of Propositions 1 and 2, neither in the weights, which appear less structured
and less interpretable, nor in linear probings of preconditioned tokens, where we barely observe a gradual
improvement over layers as well as an overall worse probing performance. Lastly, all trained transformers,
including a single mesa-layer seem to outperform optimization-algorithms in this settings, indicating that the
models learn the fixed teacher and thereby predict with very low error already very early in the sequence, as
we also find in next-token prediction analyses.

Figure 12 | No evidence for mesa-optimization in Transformers trained on fixed-teacher linear dynamics, as predicted
by our theory. (A) At convergence, one layer linear self-attention transformers trained on fixed-teacher linear sequences
significantly outperform the performance achieved by a single update step of gradient descent (dashed line). (B) In six-layer
linear self-attention models trained on constructed tokens, we only find very weak linear probing of preconditioned inputs

(D) We find less structured and less interpretable weights in a trained one-layer transformer.

F. Experimental details
F.1. Training Transformers on fully observable linear dynamical systems
We provide here details about the training details of the Transformer models when training on the fully
observable linear dynamics setting. As already stated in the main text, we train all Transformer models by
minimizing the following classical autoregressive prediction error objective regression loss:
"
L ( 𝜃) = 𝔼𝑒∼ 𝑝 ( 𝑒 )

#
𝑇 −1
1 ∑︁
2
∥ 𝑒𝑡+1 − 𝑓𝑡 ( 𝑒1:𝑡 , 𝜃) ∥ .
2 𝑡=1

(66)

In all of our experiments, we employ causal masking during self-attention, implemented in the same way as in
the majority of auto-regressive language modeling experiments. Specifically, during the self-attention operation
we zero out the elements corresponding to the upper triangular matrix of the attention map, except for the
diagonal itself. We do this both for the linear attention layer and for the mesa-layer. In practice, for softmax
self-attention the incoming logits to the softmax are set to −1𝑒30 . We ran into stability issues especially when
training models with linear layers. To mitigate those, we simply clipped the activations of the forward pass
to values between [−4, 4] for linear self-attention Transformer-layers, which stabilized training significantly.
Hyperparameters and other experimental details can be found in table 1.
F.1.1. Single-layer linear self-attention Transformer
We analyze single-layer, two-head, key-size-20 linear self-attention Transformers, trained on constructed
tokens, by comparing their performance with other models and providing an interpolation in parameter space
between trained Transformers and the provided construction for Proposition 1, which is described by only a
few hyper-parameters. We read out the predictions from the first 𝐷𝑠 entries of the outputs (which initially
contain a zero-vector). For the performance analysis, these models are compared to a Proposition 1, thus a
single gradient descent update step on the auto-regressive loss. The optimal learning rate for this gradient
descent step is line-searched.
Interpolation details: We first train a Transformer, then extract scalar parameters of the mesa-optimization
algorithm, from the 𝐷𝑠 × 𝐷𝑠 -shaped sub-matrices by taking the mean of the sub-diagonals of the matrix products
𝑊𝑘⊤𝑊𝑞 , 𝑃𝑊𝑣 (cf. 13). We proceed by using these to both build a construction of sparse weight matrices, each
consisting only of identity-sub-matrices (scaled by the resp. parameters), and, for the single-layer case, also
directly compute a loss for the hard-coded implementation of Proposition 1 with the respective hyper-parameters.
Then, during a second training-run of a Transformer for the same initial conditions, we simultaneously compute
the test loss for an interpolation, where we average equally not between the single weight matrices, but between
the correct weight-matrix-products per head to obtain a new, interpolated model. The reason for this procedure

starting from 0 to 7𝑒 −4 in 1000 steps, Cosine annealing to 1𝑒 − 5 for the next
10000 (single-layer interpolation experiments), 30000 (other experiments) steps.
We note here that we train the models only for at most 10000 steps, except for the ICLsetting where we do Cosine annealing for 60000 steps and train for 40000 steps.

F.1.2. Multi-layer linear self-attention Transformer
For the multi-layer experiments, we use different settings: For the experiments with constructed tokens, we
use a 𝑘-layer (𝑘 > 1), no input- or output-embedding layer architecture, we found that forward-pass activation
clipping in linear self-attention based Transformers after each layer greatly stabilized training and hence clip
activations in a band of [−4, 4].
Interpolation details: The interpolation of multi-layer transformers when training on the token construction,
we follow the procedure described in the previous subsection, per layer, but extend it to 4-head key-size
40 self-attention layers: We read off the parameters as the mean of the diagonals of the respective 𝑛𝑠 × 𝑛𝑠
sub-matrices of the resulting matrix weight products 𝑊𝑘⊤𝑊𝑞 , 𝑃𝑊𝑣 per head of a trained Transformer. Then we
construct sparse weight matrices consisting of identity-sub-matrices (scaled by the resp. parameters). We name
this algorithm Compressed-Alg-6. We proceed as for the single-layer experiment and re-train the Transformer
from the initial conditions, but during training also report the test loss of a model that is obtained by equally
averaging the weight products of our construction for Compressed-Alg-6 and the Transformer. We average the
products and not the single weight matrices for the same reasons stated in the previous subsection F.1.1 and
report the loss obtained in runs for 5 different seeds.
F.1.3. Full-fledged Transformers
For the experiments with full-fledged Transformers, we use either a 7-layer full-softmax architecture or 1+1
softmax-mesa and mesa-mesa hybrid-models. In all full-fledged models, we have input- and output-embedding
layers, and the first layer always incorporates the logic for the positional encodings, while the other Transformer
layers are either 6 softmax self-attention layers, or 1 mesa layer (1+1-layer architecture). The positional
encodings are concatenated to the outputs of the key- and query projections before the computation of the
attention.
Analysing copying behaviour in full-fledged Transformers: We examine Transformers trained on linear sequence
models to understand if they learn a token-binding process in early layers to construct aggregate internal
token representations, which are necessary for the proposed mesa-optimization algorithms in subsequent
layers. We analyse the causally masked attention maps of trained models (cf. 14, 15) and find clear dataindependent attention on both the current and the previous token at each time-step. Furthermore, we propose
a token-probing and a gradient sensitivity experiment (cf. 16, 17) to understand if the transformed tokens
after the first Transformer layer contain both the current as well as the previous token in the sequence, as
necessary for our hypothesis. For the token probing, we report the performance of linear decoders trained
to predict previous tokens from output. There, we linearly regress a batch of sequences at a single time-step
against a range of previous time-steps and report the obtained MSE loss. We find that, as predicted by our
hypothesis, Transformers learn a process that data-independently binds previous and current tokens at each
time steps to construct the proposed representations internally. We support this evidence by further analyses
where we compute the sensitivity norm ∥∇𝑠𝑡′ 𝑓𝑡(1) ( 𝑠1:𝑡 , 𝜃) ∥ of the output of the first layer for all time steps 𝑡 ′ ≤ 𝑡 .
Furthermore we analyse full-mesa (first and second layer mesa) models and report the findings for the above
experiments. Here, we find weaker and less clear - but still existing binding of previous tokens at each time-step.

F.1.4. Testing autoregressively trained Transformers on few-shot in-context-learning
We provide here details about the post-training in-context learning experiment. For this experiment, we
exclusively analyse full-fledged Transformers. After training, we "prompt" the model with few-shot regression datasets i.e. simply switch from sequences [ 𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , . . . , 𝑥𝑡 −1 , 𝑥𝑡 ] where 𝑥𝑡+1 = 𝑊 𝑥𝑡 and 𝑥0 ∼ N (0, 𝐼 ) to

the autoregressive case. In both cases we sample 𝑊 , if not stated otherwise from the same distribution i.e. as
random orthogonal matrices. This results in a sequence length of 𝑡 = 2 𝑁 and 𝑡 = 3 𝑁 when incorporating EOS
tokens. Throughout the sequence we measure

Figure 18 | Autoregressive Transformers display in-context few-shot learning capabilities. After training a hybrid-mesa
Transformer on autoregressive sequence prediction problems, we measure its ability to solve linear regression tasks incontext, without further parameter fine-tuning. The task training set is presented to the model in sequence, with each
token corresponding either to an input or to its corresponding label. A final test input is provided and the loss is measured
after completing the sequence using the autoregressive Transformer. (A) The mesa-optimizers installed by autoregressive
pretraining can be leveraged off-the-shelf to solve in-context supervised regression tasks, but yield sub-optimal regression
performance (lightest red lines). In-context learning performance can be improved following the standard strategies of
prompt (TF+EOS, light red lines) and prefix fine-tuning (TF+EOS+P, dark red lines). For comparison, we provide the loss
achieved by an autoregressive linear model learned by least-squares (LSQ, yellow lines) (B) Same analysis, now presenting

data-dimension to 4 : 1. Then, for each of the listed settings (𝑛𝑠 ∈ [4, 6, 10, 20, 40, 60] and 𝑇 according to the
fixed ratio) we first train a classical full-fledged softmax-attention Transformer model on data generated by a
linear-sequence generating teacher. We note here that for larger dimensions, the training becomes significantly
more difficult in this setting. Then, for each layer in the model, we distill a separate linear self-attention layer
by training it to ‘behave’ like its softmax-counterpart. To this end, we record the outputs of the softmax-layer
for a new input-sequence. Note that the inputs to the linear layer that we are training are not the original
input-sequences, but rather the (transformed) sequences that are the activations before the softmax-layer in the
multi-layer softmax-Transformer. Hence, the distillation process is described by optimizing this objective:

Here, SA ( 𝑙 ) denotes the softmax attention operation at the 𝑙 -th layer of the full-softmax transformer, 𝜃softmax,𝑙 the
(learned) parameters for this operation, LSA the linear self-attention layer and 𝑓𝑡( 𝑙 −1) ( 𝑠1:𝑡 , 𝜃TF ) the activation
after the ( 𝑙 − 1)-th layer in the trained full-softmax Transformer, which will be the input to the linear layer
we aim to distill. After this distiallation process is completed, we construct a model where we swap out the
softmax operation at the respective layer and replace it by the distilled layer in the full-softmax model. Then
we compare the performance of this new ‘linearized’ Transformer with the original full-softmax model on a
batch of test sequences and report the measured test loss. Furthermore, we find that the distilled weights that
were trained on the in- and outputs of a specific softmax-layer appear to be very similar to softmax-attention
layers in structure, cf. 19.
Furthermore, we analyse and compare the performance of autoregressive models learned by regularized
least squares and an generic interpolation algorithm, softmax-kernel-regression, in various settings as described
above. We line-search the parameters necessary for regularization. Here, we extend these results and also
analyse these settings for varying noise settings in the generating model. We report mean and standard
deviation for three different seeds, each using generated data of batch-size 32, in 20.

always incorporates the logic for the positional encodings, while the other Transformer layers are either 6

Analysing copying behaviour in full-fledged Transformers: We examine Transformers trained on partially
observable linear sequence models to understand if they learn a token-binding process in early layers to
construct aggregate internal token representations, which are necessary for the proposed mesa-optimization
algorithms in subsequent layers. As in the fully-observable setting, we use both a token-probing and a gradient
sensitivity experiment to understand if the transformed tokens after the first Transformer layer contain the
previous tokens in the sequence, as necessary for our hypothesis for partially observable models. For the token
probing (cf. 21), we report the performance of linear decoders trained to predict previous tokens from output.
There, we linearly regress a batch of sequences at a single time-step against a range of previous time-steps
and report the obtained MSE loss for models of varying embedding dimension. We find that as the embedding
dimension grows, the probing of previous tokens becomes more clear and stable. Hence we infer that, as
expected by our hypothesis, Transformers learn a process that data-independently binds previous and current
tokens at each time steps to construct the proposed representations internally. We support this evidence by
further analyses where we compute the sensitivity norm ∥∇𝑠𝑡′ 𝑓𝑡(1) ( 𝑠1:𝑡 , 𝜃) ∥ of the output of the first layer for all
time steps 𝑡 ′ ≤ 𝑡 (cf. 22).

are either 6 softmax self-attention layers, or 1 mesa layer (1+1-layer architecture). The positional encodings
are concatenated to the outputs of the key- and query projections before the computation of the attention.
Furthermore, we use MLPs with hidden dimension 300 (factor 5× if compared with embedding-dimension for
the models, which we set to 50-dimensional) and a specialized version of normalization, sum normalization, as
introduced by [33], where we divide the query and key projections by their respective sums of components.
Further training details can be found in 3.

G. Language modeling
We present here first preliminary results on the performance of models which replace (some) softmax selfattention layer with the mesa-layer. Our hypothesis is that the mesa-layer will improve the in-context learning
and working memory capabilities of a Transformer, in particular of the linear kind. We further hypothesize that
this in turn translates to language modeling improvements, based on the high correlation between in-context
learning and actual autoregressive loss reported by Kaplan et al. [50]. We therefore quantify performance
along two axes: the next-token prediction loss, the actual objective of base-optimization; and the ability to learn
in-context, measured as the difference in loss calculated over two timepoints within a sequence, as defined by
Kaplan et al. [50] and Olsson et al. [5].

Uncovering mesa-optimization algorithms in Transformers

Figure 26 | Single-layer Transformers with key-shifts, the Pile. We observe improved (A) perplexity and (B) in-context
learning scores when comparing one linear to one mesa layer with different DPFP sizes 𝜈 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, corresponding
inversely to color fade. Mesa layers consistently outperform linear layers, catching up with softmax.

Figure 27 | Language modeling experiments on the Pile. We observe improved perplexity and in-context learning scores
across all our language modeling experiments when switching from standard linear self-attention to the mesa-layer. As
hypothesized, we confirm that in all models various copying heads can be found in the first softmax layer, see Figure 28 for
visualizations of the attention heads. (A&B) 2-layer Transformers without MLPs and first layers softmax self-attention and
second layer either softmax, mesa or linear. (C&D) 4-layer Transformers with MLPs and first layers softmax self-attention
and rest of the layers either all softmax, mesa or linear.

We train Transformers with various architectural configurations on the Pile [99], a large compilation of
various English text datasets including parts of Wikipedia, arXiv, and code. We always model the first layer using
softmax self-attention in all experiments. This decision is based on insights from our previous experiments,
where base-optimization consistently attributed a mesa-objective creation role to this layer. We then compare
pure softmax-only Transformers to two types of hybrid models, where the subsequent layers are either linear
or mesa. We vary the depth of our models, from 2-layer attention-only to deeper 4-attention-layer models
endowed with tokenwise MLPs which are present by default in standard Transformers. By transforming the data
nonlinearly, MLP layers allow solving nonlinear regression problems by mesa-gradient descent. Following this
reasoning, we further adopt in our hybrid-linear and hybrid-mesa Transformers the deterministic parameter-free
projection (DPFP, size denoted by 𝜈) due to Schlag et al. [33], a non-learned and simple to compute nonlinear
transformation of keys and queries. We found that this significantly improved the performance of non-softmax
attention layers. Finally, to represent discrete input symbols as real-valued vectors, we learn a vocabulary of
real-valued vectors using the standard GPT-2 tokenizer. We note that all models have an (almost) identical
number of parameters.
In line with our synthetic experiments, we observe stable learning across all model types of copying layers,
indicated by the constant attention to tokens in direct or close proximity, as shown in Figure 28. We therefore
reproduce the findings of Olsson et al. [5], extending them to models that include other forms of attention.
This phenomenon is predicted by the mesa-optimization theory presented here, where copy layers serve the
purpose of constructing internal mesa-objective functions. We note that, in contrast to our previous synthetic
linear prediction tasks, the Pile is no longer Markovian of order 1. This is reflected in the more complicated
attention maps, indicating more involved copying behavior. Additionally, we run an ablation where we compare
to a single-layer control model whose first softmax layer is removed and replaced by a hardcoded one-step
key-shift operator. Interestingly, such an operator can be found in previous work [5, 45]. Again, we verify
the findings of [5] and observe strong in-context learning scores, within a single layer, with the mesa-layer
performing on-par with softmax, see Figure 26. As in [33], DPFP features substantially improve performance;
we fix 𝜈 = 3 for the linear as well as the mesa layer for all other language modeling experiments.

We find that the hybrid-mesa Transformers dominate their hybrid-linear counterparts in terms of performance,
across all configurations, essentially matching (for 2-layer models) or coming closer (for 4-layer models with
MLPs) to pure-softmax Transformers, cf. Figure 27. We leave for future work studying the mesa-layer equipped
with forgetting factors, see Appendix C.1, which could further improve upon our results here. This is reflected
both in terms of perplexity and in-context learning scores. Strictly speaking, these results are not sufficient
to make claims on whether mesa-optimization is occurring within standard Transformers. However, the
high performance achieved by the hybrid-mesa models, which operate on mesa-optimization principles by
design, suggests that mesa-optimization might be happening within conventional Transformers. More reverseengineering work is needed to add weight to this conjecture.
We provide now additional details about the language modeling experiments. We use standard values
found in the literature and the same hyperparameters, which we did not tune, across all experiments. We, if
not stated otherwise, use the standard GPT-2 transformer architecture with LayerNorm [28], MLPs between
self-attention layer and skip-connection after every layer which we train on a standard (autoregressively)
masked cross-entropy loss. We do not use an input embedding layer but an output projection before computing
the logits. To train enable stable training of the linear as well as the mesa-layer, we apply the proposed key and
query normalization of schlag and simply devide them by their L2 norm. Intriguingly, this stabilizes training
drastically also for the mesa-layer after which we did not observe any more instabilities. Note that this is very
similar to using additional LayerNorm [28] on the keys and queries. Except from this normalization, all models
are constructed and trained identically. See 4 for an overview of all design decisions and hyperparameters.
Also, we refer to the appendix of [33] on how to compute the DPFP kernels to non-linearly alter the key and
query features,we use 𝜈 = 3 if not stated otherwise.

H. Software
The results reported in this paper were produced with open-source software. We used the Python programming
language together with the Google JAX [97] framework, and the NumPy [101], Matplotlib [102], Flax [103]
and Optax [104] packages.

attention maps of the first softmax-attention layer over a batch of size 256 and observe stable off diagonals with different
offsets and widths indicating clean copying behavior based on positional encodings in multiple heads.
