# Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

## Full text

### Abstract (from OpenAlex metadata)

Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between “learningaware” agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing
approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules
or enforce a strict separation between “naive learners” updating on fast timescales and “meta-learners”
observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence
models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit
timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution
of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning
algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in
prior work—where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping—emerges naturally in this setting:
in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape
the opponent’s in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our
results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with
co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

1. Introduction
The development of foundation model agents is rapidly shifting the landscape of artificial intelligence
from isolated systems to interacting autonomous agents (Aguera Y Arcas et al., 2026; Park et al.,
2023; Xi et al., 2023). As these sequence-model-based agents are deployed in increasingly complex
environments, they inevitably face multi-agent interactions where outcomes depend on interactions
of multiple entities. Because these interactions frequently involve competing goals, ensuring that selfinterested agents robustly cooperate in mixed-motive settings remains an important open challenge,
even as individual agent capabilities have grown significantly.
Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) addresses the problem of learning to
interact with other agents while only having access to local observations. However, decentralized
MARL is challenging due to two primary factors: equilibrium selection and non-stationarity of
the environment (Hernandez-Leal et al., 2017; Shoham & Leyton-Brown, 2008). In general-sum
games, many Nash equilibria may exist, and agents independently optimizing their own rewards
frequently converge to suboptimal outcomes, such as mutual defection in social dilemmas (Claus
& Boutilier, 1998; Foerster et al., 2018). Furthermore, from the perspective of a single agent, the
environment is non-stationary because other agents are simultaneously learning and adapting their
policies (Hernandez-Leal et al., 2017). Since standard single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms assume stationarity, they often fail to learn effective policies in these decentralized settings
(Claus & Boutilier, 1998; Foerster et al., 2018).
To address this non-stationarity, co-player learning awareness enables agents to anticipate the learning
dynamics of other agents and shape their co-players’ learning toward more beneficial equilibria (Agha© 2026 Google. All rights reserved

johari et al., 2024a,b; Balaguer et al., 2022; Cooijmans et al., 2023; Duque et al., 2024; Foerster et al.,
2018; Khan et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2022; Meulemans et al., 2025a; Piche et al., 2025; Segura et al.,
2025; Willi et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2021). These approaches generally fall into two categories. The
first explicitly models the co-player’s learning update, estimating a shaping gradient by differentiating
through the opponent’s update step (Aghajohari et al., 2024a,b; Cooijmans et al., 2023; Duque
et al., 2024; Foerster et al., 2018; Piche et al., 2025; Willi et al., 2022). However, this requires rigid
assumptions about the opponent’s learning rule and creates inconsistencies if the opponent is also
learning-aware. The second category implicitly learns to shape opponents by extending the RL time
horizon to encompass multiple update steps of the co-player (Khan et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2022;
Meulemans et al., 2025a; Segura et al., 2025). While effective, this requires a separation of agents
into “naive learners” (who update parameters frequently) and “meta-learners” (who update slowly),
effectively treating the interaction as a meta-learning problem (Bengio et al., 1990; Hochreiter et al.,
2001; Schmidhuber, 1987).
Meulemans et al. (2025a) describe a three-step mechanism explaining why co-player learning
awareness leads to the learning of cooperative behaviors among self-interested agents:
1. Extortion of naive learners: The optimal strategy against a naive learner (an agent updating its
policy to maximize rewards on a fast timescale) is extortion (Press & Dyson, 2012). A learningaware meta-agent shapes the interaction so the naive learner updates its policy towards more
cooperation, allowing the meta-agent to exploit the resulting behavior.
2. Mutual extortion leads to cooperation: When two agents with such extortionate capabilities
face each other, their attempts to shape the learning of one another result in both agents learning
more cooperative strategies.
3. Heterogeneity is key: Consequently, cooperation emerges when agents are trained in a mixed
population of naive learners and learning-aware agents. Interactions with naive learners provide
the gradient pressure to learn extortion (avoiding mutual defection), while interactions with
learning-aware agents refine this into mutual cooperation.
We argue that the complex mechanisms employed by current co-player learning-aware methods, such
as explicit naive learners and meta learners, or differentiating through co-players’ learning updates,
are unnecessary for learning cooperative behaviors. We hypothesize that training sequence model
agents via decentralized MARL against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally yields in-context
best-response policies. These policies exhibit goal-directed adaptation through in-context learning
within a single episode. Crucially, we show that this acts as a functional drop-in replacement for
the “naive learner” parameter updates of prior work. Because in-context learning occurs on a fast
timescale within the episode, agents become susceptible to extortion by other learning agents using
in-weight updates. Consequently, the cooperative gradient dynamics identified by Meulemans et al.
(2025a) emerge: gradients incentivizing the extortion of in-context learners pull agents away from
pure defection, while mutual extortion gradients drive them toward cooperation.
Our contributions are as follows. We introduce a decentralized MARL setup where sequence model
agents are trained against a mixed pool of diverse co-players and demonstrate that this training
distribution induces strong in-context co-player inference capabilities and thereby the mutual extortion
pressures leading to cooperation. We show that this setup leads to robust cooperation in the Iterated
Prisoner’s Dilemma without the distinction between meta and inner trajectories, or assumptions
about opponent learning rules. By bridging in-context learning and co-player learning-awareness, we
provide a scalable path toward cooperative multi-agent systems using standard sequence modeling
and RL. We introduce a new RL method that leverages self-supervised learning of predictive sequence
models, which is well-suited to learn the in-context best-response policies required for the mixed pool

training. We provide a theoretical characterization of the training equilibrium of this method, and
relate it to Nash equilibria and subjective embedded equilibria (Meulemans et al., 2025b).

2. Problem setup and methods
Partially observable stochastic games. We formalize the multi-agent interaction as a partially
observable stochastic game (POSG; Kuhn, 1953) of 𝑁 agents. Each agent 𝑖 receives at each timestep
an observation 𝑜𝑡𝑖 ∈ O 𝑖 and reward 𝑟𝑡𝑖 ∈ R 𝑖 , and executes an action 𝑎𝑡𝑖 ∈ A 𝑖 , with O 𝑖 , R 𝑖 and A 𝑖 being
finite sets. Policies are conditioned on the interaction history 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 = {( 𝑜𝑖𝑘 , 𝑎𝑖𝑘 −1 , 𝑟𝑘𝑖 −1 )}𝑡𝑘=1 . We denote
the policy of agent 𝑖 as 𝜋𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑡𝑖 | 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 ; 𝜙𝑖 ), parameterized by 𝜙𝑖 .
The iterated prisoner’s dilemma. We focus on the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD), a canonical
model for studying cooperation among self-interested agents (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Rapoport,
1974). In each round 𝑡 , two agents choose simultaneously to cooperate (C) or defect (D), i.e.,
𝑎𝑡𝑖 ∈ {C, D}, receiving payoffs as detailed in Tab. 1. This structure creates a social dilemma: in a
single-shot game, mutual defection is the unique Nash equilibrium, even though mutual cooperation
yields higher global and individual returns. While the infinitely iterated game allows for cooperative
Nash equilibria, converging to these equilibria via decentralized reinforcement learning remains
challenging (Claus & Boutilier, 1998; Foerster et al., 2018). For computational tractability, we
approximate the infinite horizon with a fixed horizon of 𝑇 = 100 steps, which is sufficient for the
small-scale policy networks used in this work to approximate infinite-horizon behavior.
Mixed pool training. To induce robust in-context inference capabilities, we train agents within
a mixed population rather than against a single fixed opponent. The training pool consists of
(i) Learning Agents which use a sequence model policy that processes the full episode history 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡
and whose parameters are learned during training, and (ii) static Tabular Agents parameterized by a
5-dimensional vector, defining the probability of cooperating in the initial state and in response to the
𝑖
four possible joint action outcomes of the previous turn ( 𝑎𝑡𝑖 −1 , 𝑎𝑡−−1
). During training, a learning agent
plays 50% of its episodes against another learning agent and 50% against a tabular agent sampled
uniformly from the parameter space. Crucially, agents do not receive agent identifiers; they must
infer the nature and strategy of their opponent solely from the interaction history 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 .
We investigate two learning algorithms for the learning agents in our pool:
Independent A2C. We employ Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) (Mnih et al., 2016) as a standard
decentralized model-free RL method. Each agent independently optimizes its policy parameters 𝜙𝑖 to
maximize its own expected return, treating the other agents as part of the environment.
Predictive Policy Improvement (PPI). We introduce a model-based algorithm that leverages a
sequence model predicting the joint sequence of actions, observations, and rewards, serving simultaneously as a world model and a policy prior. This method is a variation of Maximum A-Posteriori
Policy Optimization (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018, MPO), inspired by the MUPI framework for multi-agent
learning (Meulemans et al., 2025b), and enables efficient learning of in-context inference mechanisms
through self-supervised training. Each iteration consists of (i) gathering data with the improved
policy and (ii) retraining the sequence model on the newly gathered data, similar to classical policy
iteration. We define the improved policy 𝜋𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑖 | 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 ) as follows:


ˆ 𝑝𝑖 ( 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 , 𝑎𝑖 ) ,
𝜋𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑖 | 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 ) ∝ 𝑝𝜙𝑖 𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑖 | 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 ) · exp 𝛽 𝑄
(1)
ˆ 𝑝 ( ℎ, 𝑎) is estimated via Monte
where 𝛽 is an inverse temperature hyperparameter. The action value 𝑄
Carlo rollouts performed within the sequence model 𝑝𝜙 . We deploy this improved policy 𝜋𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑖 | 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 ) in
the games interacting with other agents, collecting a new batch of trajectories. We end the iteration by

model 𝑝𝜙 by pretraining on interactions between randomly sampled tabular agents. Refer to App. A
for the implementation details, App. C for a theoretical derivation and motivation of PPI, and App. D
for a theoretical analysis of the equilibrium behavior of PPI agents.

3. Results
Our central hypothesis is that training the learning agents against a diverse distribution of co-players
necessitates the development of two distinct capabilities: (i) inferring the co-player’s policy from
interaction history, and (ii) adapting to a best response within a single episode. We posit that this
in-context best-response policy makes the agent vulnerable to extortion, reproducing the “naive learner”
dynamics described by Meulemans et al. (2025a). This leads to learning pressures towards extortion
policies, and subsequently, the mutual extortion between learning agents drives the agents toward
cooperative policies. Interestingly, in this setup, the learning agents simultaneously occupy two roles
traditionally separated in the literature: they are “naive learners” on the fast timescale (via in-context
learning) and “learning-aware agents” on the slow timescale (via weight updates).
In this section, we first demonstrate that mixed-pool training indeed leads to robust cooperation
without explicit time-scale separations or meta-gradient machinery. We then dissect the underlying
mechanism, showing that (1) mixed pool training induces in-context best-response policies, (2)
these policies are vulnerable to extortion, and (3) mutual extortion pressures resolve into learning
cooperative behaviors.
3.1. Mixed training induces robust cooperation
As shown in Figure 1, both PPI and A2C agents trained in the mixed pool setup converge to cooperation
in IPD. To verify this stems from the dynamics of in-context opponent inference, we perform two
ablations: (1) Explicit Identification: We condition the policy on the opponent’s policy parameters
(for tabular opponents) or identity flag (for other learning agents) at the start of the episode, removing
the need for in-context opponent inference. (2) No mixed pool training: We train agents solely
against a single other learning agent (without the tabular agent pool or structured pretraining).

Figure 2 | A–B: Emergence of in-context best response. Performance of PPI agents (trained against random
tabular opponents) when evaluated against specific fixed strategies. The agents demonstrate in-context learning,
identifying the opponent and converging to the best response within the episode. C–D: Learning to extort
in-context learners. Agents trained against a “Fixed In-Context Learner” (an agent pre-trained in Step 1 to
best-respond to tabular policies) learn to extort it. The RL agent achieves a higher share of the reward by
exploiting the in-context adaptation of its opponent. E–F: From mutual extortion to cooperation. When
two agents initialized with extortion policies (from Step 2) play against each other, their mutual attempts to
extort their co-player result in the shaping of each other’s policy towards more cooperative behavior, both
within episodes through in-context learning (F) and across episodes through in-weight learning (E). Error bars
indicate standard deviation across 10 random seeds.

Without diverse opponents, agents have no incentive to develop general-purpose in-context learning
mechanisms. In both ablations, agents collapse to mutual defection (c.f. Fig. 1; dashed and dotted
curves). This confirms that in-context learning mechanisms—induced by the necessity to identify
diverse opponents—are a critical factor enabling cooperative outcomes. Refer to App. A.4 for the
ablation details.
3.2. Mechanism analysis: From in-context learning to cooperation
We now deconstruct the learning of cooperative behavior into three distinct steps, validating the
causal chain from diversity to in-context learning, to extortability, and finally to cooperation.
Step 1: Diversity induces in-context best-response mechanisms. First, we verify that training
against the tabular pool cultivates in-context learning. We evaluate a PPI agent trained solely against
the tabular agents pool. Figure 2B plots the agent’s performance against specific tabular policies over
5

the course of an episode. The agent rapidly adapts to the best response for the specific opponent. This
confirms the emergence of in-context best-response mechanisms that perform goal-directed adaptation
on the fast timescale of the episode.
Step 2: In-context learners are vulnerable to extortion. Next, we establish that such in-context
best-response policies are susceptible to shaping by other co-players. We freeze the agent from Step 1,
termed the "Fixed In-Context Learner" (Fixed-ICL), and train a new PPI agent solely against it. The
new agent learns to extort the Fixed-ICL policy (Fig. 2C&D) (Press & Dyson, 2012). By exploiting the
Fixed-ICL’s tendency to adapt, the new agent forces it into unfair cooperation, maximizing the new
agent’s own reward at the expense of the Fixed-ICL. This confirms that goal-directed adaptation within
the episode provides the necessary gradient signal for opponents to learn extortionate behaviors via
weight updates.
Step 3: Mutual extortion drives cooperation. We initialize two agents with the extortion policies
learned in Step 2 and train them against each other. Within an episode, both extortion policies
shape each others in-context learning dynamics into more cooperative behavior (Fig. 2F). This push
towards more cooperation is then picked up by the parameter updates, further driving both policies
towards cooperative behavior (Fig. 2E), mirroring the "mutual shaping" effect observed in explicit
learning-aware methods (Lu et al., 2022; Meulemans et al., 2025a).
Step 4: Synthesis in mixed populations. Mixed-pool training combines these dynamics by forcing
agents to maintain in-context adaptation for tabular opponents, which renders them vulnerable to
mutual extortion by other learners, ultimately driving the learning agents toward cooperation through
mutual extortion (Sec. 3.1; Fig. 1 & Fig. 3). Figure 4 in Appendix B.2 shows similar results for A2C
learning agents.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we have demonstrated that the complex machinery of explicit co-player learningawareness—such as meta gradients or rigid timescale separation—is not required to learn cooperative
behaviors in general-sum games. Instead, we found that simply training agents against a diverse
distribution of co-players suffices to induce in-context best-response strategies. This in-context learning
renders agents susceptible to shaping and consequently driving them toward cooperative behaviors
through mutual extortion dynamics. Crucially, this result bridges the gap between multi-agent
reinforcement learning and the training paradigms of modern foundation models. Since foundation
models naturally exhibit in-context learning and are trained on diverse tasks and behaviors, our
findings suggest a scalable and computationally efficient path for the emergence of cooperative social
behaviors using standard decentralized learning techniques.

Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

A. Additional details on methods
A.1. Partially observable stochastic games
We formalize the multi-agent interaction as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG; Kuhn,
1953) defined by the tuple (I , S , A , 𝑃𝑡 , 𝑃𝑟 , 𝑃 𝑖 , O , 𝑃𝑜 , 𝛾, 𝑇 ). Here, I = {1, . . . , 𝑛} is the set of 𝑛 agents.
At each time step 𝑡 , the environment is in state 𝑠𝑡 ∈ S. Agents simultaneously select actions from the
joint action space A = ×𝑖 ∈ I A 𝑖 , transitioning the environment according to 𝑃𝑡 ( 𝑆𝑡+1 | 𝑆𝑡 , 𝐴𝑡 ). The initial
state is sampled from 𝑃𝑖 ( 𝑠0 ). Each agent 𝑖 receives a reward 𝑟𝑡𝑖 from the joint factorized distribution
𝑃𝑟 = ×𝑖 ∈ I 𝑃𝑟𝑖 ( 𝑟 𝑖 | 𝑠, 𝑎), and an observation 𝑜𝑡𝑖 from the observation space O = ×𝑖 ∈ I O 𝑖 via the distribution
𝑃𝑜 ( 𝑜𝑡 | 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 −1 ). We denote the discount factor by 𝛾 and the horizon by 𝑇 . We use the superscript 𝑖
to denote variables specific to agent 𝑖, and −𝑖 for the remaining agents. Policies are conditioned on
the interaction history 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 = {( 𝑜𝑖𝑘 , 𝑎𝑖𝑘 −1 , 𝑟𝑘𝑖 −1 )}𝑡𝑘=1 . We denote the policy of agent 𝑖 as 𝜋𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑡𝑖 | 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 ; 𝜙𝑖 ),
parameterized by 𝜙𝑖 .
A.2. Environment
Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) In each round both
agents can output two possible actions: cooperate (𝐶 ) and Table 1 | Single-round IPD payoff matrix
defect ( 𝐷). As such, the environment emits five possible observations: the initial observation 𝑠0 and four observations based

on the actions the two players took in the previous round:

D
( 𝐶, 𝐶 ) , ( 𝐶, 𝐷) , ( 𝐷, 𝐶 ) , ( 𝐷, 𝐷). The state 𝑠𝑡 is then comprised of
all past observations 𝑜 ≤ 𝑡 . While the tabular agents are only

conditioned on the latest observation 𝑜𝑡 , the PPI and A2C
D (2, -1) (0, 0)
agents leverage the full history 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 . Each game consists of 100
rounds. Each agent observes the state of the previous round
from a first person view, i.e., its own action is enumerated first. In every round, each agent receives a
reward following the payoff matrix in Tab. 1.
A.3. Agent implementations
A.3.1. PPI agents
Predictive Policy Improvement (PPI) agents, our practical approximation of embedded Bayesian
agents (Meulemans et al., 2025b), combine a learned sequence model with a planning-based policy
improvement mechanism.
Sequence Model Architecture. The sequence model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a 128dimensional hidden state. Inputs—comprising observations, actions, and rewards—are processed
via modality-specific linear layers to project them into a shared 32-dimensional embedding space;
observations and actions are one-hot encoded prior to projection. These embeddings serve as inputs
to the GRU, and we apply the Swish activation function (Ramachandran et al., 2017) on the output.
Distinct linear output heads decode the hidden states to predict future tokens for each modality.
Training Objectives. We train the sequence model iteratively for 30 phases. In each phase, the
model parameters 𝜙 are re-initialized and trained on a dataset of interaction histories D = { 𝑥 ( 𝑛 ) } 𝑛𝑁=1
to minimize the next-token prediction loss:

D comprises of the interaction histories from all previous and current phases. This is a common
strategy in performative prediction (Perdomo et al., 2020) to ensure more stable training of the
prediction model.
We model 𝑝𝜙 ( 𝑎𝑡 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) and 𝑝𝜙 ( 𝑜𝑡 | 𝑥 <𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 −1 ) using a categorical distribution, yielding a standard
categorical cross-entropy loss and we model 𝑝𝜙 ( 𝑟𝑡 | 𝑥 <𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 −1 , 𝑜𝑡 ) with a normal distribution with fixed
variance, yielding the mean-square error loss ( 𝑟 − 𝑟ˆ) 2 . In each phase, we sample 20 000 trajectories,
which are concatenated with samples from previous phases for joint training of the sequence model.
Optimization is performed using AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) (learning rate 10−4 , weight
decay 10−2 , 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.98) for 10 epochs with a batch size of 256. Gradients are clipped at a
norm of 1.0.
Pre-training The sequence model is pretrained on an initial dataset D0 of 200 000 sample trajectories
of two random tabular agents playing IPD against each other for 100 rounds using the same training
hyperparameters as outlined above.
Inference During deployment, the agent estimates Q values by performing Monte Carlo roll-outs for
15 rounds into the future using the learned sequence model as a simulator. The final action selection

follows a policy 𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) that re-weights the model’s prior probability 𝑝 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ; 𝜙) by the estimated

We use 𝛽 = 0.01 for all experiments.
A.3.2. Model-free agent
Architecture We implement an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent (Mnih et al., 2016) using a
GRU-based sequence model with the same configuration as for the PPI agents. The GRU takes as
input the history of observations of previous rounds and outputs the next action. The GRU is further
augmented with a linear output head to estimate the value function 𝑉 ( 𝑥 ). During training, we estimate
the advantage 𝐴 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) using bootstrapped temporal-difference errors:
𝐴 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) = 𝑟𝑡 + 𝛾𝑉 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡+1 ) − 𝑉 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) .

The model parameters are updated to minimize the combined policy gradient and value estimation

Training To get comparable results, we follow the A2C training protocol from Meulemans et al.
(2025a) including the value function estimation, Generalized Advantage Estimation (Schulman et al.,
2015), advantage normalization and reward scaling. See Appendix A of Meulemans et al. (2025a)
for details.
For each experiment, we perform a hyperparameter search over the learning rate, GAE lambda,
advantage normalization, reward scaling and entropy regularization. We report the hyperparameters
corresponding to the best-performing setting in Table 2.
A.3.3. Tabular agents
Tabular agents employ a memory-1 policy defined by five parameters: the cooperation probabilities
conditional on the previous outcome (𝑐𝑐, 𝑐𝑑, 𝑑𝑐, 𝑑𝑑 ) and the initial state (𝑠0 ). Each parameter is
initialized from a uniform distribution U (0, 1).
A.4. Ablations
A.4.1. Policy conditioning
For the “Opponent ID” ablation (Fig. 1), we prepend the observation sequence x ≤ 𝑡 with a conditioning
vector z representing the opponent’s identity. For tabular agents, z is defined as the flattened vector

where O = {(𝐶, 𝐶 ) , ( 𝐶, 𝐷) , ( 𝐷, 𝐶 ) , ( 𝐷, 𝐷) , Start}. For A2C and PPI agents, z = 0.
A.4.2. No mixed pool training
For the “No Tabular Opponents” ablation (Fig. 1), we remove the tabular opponents from the mixed
agent pool for both PPI and A2C experiments. For PPI, we additionally change the pretraining data
distribution 𝐷0 to not include tabular agents but instead consist of purely random action sequences
with the corresponding rewards.

B. Additional results
B.1. In-episode trajectories for mixed pool training
Figure 3 shows the performance of PPI and A2C within a single episode during early training in the
mixed pool setting (c.f. Sec. 3.1), i.e., for phase = 8 for PPI and training iteration = 70𝑘 for A2C,
showing the emergence of in-context opponent inference and an initial gradient towards cooperation
against other learning agents.
B.2. Additional results on A2C
Figure 4 shows A2C-based results, corresponding to the PPI results presented in Figure 2 in the
main text. In Step 1, we observe that an A2C agent learns to implement best response against a
variety of tabular agents, same as for PPI. In Step 2, however, we observe that the newly trained
A2C agent manages to get a higher reward playing against the Fixed-ICL baseline than the PPI agent
(correspondingly, ∼ 1.25 vs. ∼ 0.9). This can either be caused by (i) the PPI Fixed-ICL policy being
harder to exploit or (ii) A2C finding a better exploiter policy. The irregular shape of the exploitation
dynamics in Figure 4D suggests that the A2C exploiter agent learned a complex adversarial strategy
against the A2C Fixed-ICL policy. In contrast, the PPI extortion policy of Figure 2D seems to be a
more regular extortion policy. Finally, in Step 3, the A2C agents initially move towards cooperation
but due to training instability they might still turn back to defection depending on the seed.

the beginning of the episode which subsequently leads to increased levels of cooperation. At the same time,
identifying the opponent as a non-tit-for-tat-like tabular policy leads to high defection ratio. Error bars indicate
standard deviation across 10 random seeds.

C. Derivation of Predictive Policy Improvement (PPI)
In this section, we provide a formal derivation of the Predictive Policy Improvement (PPI) algorithm.
PPI is inspired by the theoretically grounded MUPI framework (Meulemans et al., 2025b), and is
closely related to Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO; Abdolmaleki et al., 2018). PPI
departs from standard MPO by replacing the separate value function and self-model of MPO with a
single sequence model trained in a self-supervised fashion to predict actions, observations and rewards.
This model serves simultaneously as a world model and a policy prior, leveraging the generative
capabilities of sequence models for value estimation and policy representation.
C.1. Objective: The Variational Lower Bound
Í

We consider an agent optimizing its policy 𝜋 to maximize the expected return 𝑉 ( 𝜋) = 𝔼𝜏∼ℙ𝜋 𝑇𝑡=0 𝛾 𝑡 𝑟𝑡 .
To avoid notational clutter, we omit the agent-specific superscripts, as this derivation applies equally
to the single-agent setting. We introduce a parameterized sequence model 𝑝𝜙 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) which acts as a
behavioral prior or self-model over the interaction history 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 . We define a surrogate objective 𝐽 by
penalizing the KL-divergence between the behavioral policy 𝜋 and the prior 𝑝𝜙 :

𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙) = 𝔼𝜏∼ℙ𝜋
𝛾 𝑟𝑡 − 𝛼KL 𝜋 (· | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) || 𝑝𝜙 (· | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) .
(7)
𝑡 =0

Since KL(·||·) ≥ 0, 𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙) is a strict lower bound on 𝑉 ( 𝜋), with equality at 𝜋 = 𝑝𝜙 . We optimize
this bound via coordinate ascent on 𝜋 (the non-parametric policy) and 𝜙 (the parametric sequence
model).
C.2. Step 1: Non-parametric Policy Improvement w.r.t. 𝜋
Optimizing 𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙) w.r.t. 𝜋 for a fixed 𝜙 is a full-fledged optimal control problem, which generally
lacks an analytical solution and is therefore ill-suited for direct non-parametric policy improvement.
Instead, we use a first-order approximation of 𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 ) around 𝜋 = 𝑝𝜙𝑘 , where 𝑝𝜙𝑘 is the self-model
trained on the dataset gathered by deploying the previous policy 𝜋𝑘 −1 :

as all KL terms evaluate to zero under the prior. The crucial difference between 𝐽 and 𝐽¯ is that the
expectation over histories in 𝐽¯ does not depend on the policy 𝜋 being optimized, which permits a
closed-form solution for arg max𝜋 𝐽¯.
We proceed to show that 𝐽¯ is indeed a first-order approximation to 𝐽 around 𝑝𝜙𝑘 via the following
two lemmas.
Lemma C.1. 𝐽¯( 𝑝𝜙𝑘 , 𝜙𝑘 ) = 𝐽 ( 𝑝𝜙𝑘 , 𝜙𝑘 )
Proof. It is easy to see that the terms of equation 8 inside the expectation cancel out when 𝜋 = 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ,
leaving only 𝐽 ( 𝑝𝜙𝑘 , 𝜙𝑘 ).
□

Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

Lemma C.2. ∇𝜋 𝐽¯( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )| 𝜋=𝑝𝜙𝑘 = ∇𝜋 𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )| 𝜋=𝑝𝜙𝑘
Proof. We analyze the functional derivatives of both objectives with respect to the policy distribution
𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) evaluated at a specific history 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 and action 𝑎.

First, consider the surrogate objective 𝐽¯( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 ). Because the expectation over histories is fixed to
the prior distribution ℙ 𝑝𝜙𝑘 and thus does not depend on the optimization variable 𝜋, the functional
derivative is straightforward. Applying the product rule to the logarithmic term, the functional
derivative with respect to the local action probability 𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) is:


𝛿 𝐽¯( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )
𝜋( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤𝑡 )
𝑝𝜙𝑘

−𝛼 .
(9)
𝛿𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
Evaluating this derivative at the prior 𝜋 = 𝑝𝜙𝑘 , the logarithmic term vanishes (since log 1 = 0),
yielding:
𝛿 𝐽¯( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )
= ℙ 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) ( 𝑄 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎) − 𝛼) .
(10)
𝛿𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) 𝜋=𝑝𝜙
𝑘

Next, differentiating the true objective 𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 ) is more involved because 𝜋 dictates the history
visitation distribution ℙ𝜋 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ). We define the regularized Q-function, 𝑄 𝜋reg ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎), which captures the
expected return including all future KL penalties, but excluding the immediate penalty at time 𝑡 :

To find the functional derivative of the global objective 𝐽 with respect to the local policy 𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ),
we apply the continuous extension of the Performance Difference Lemma (Kakade & Langford, 2002).
This theorem establishes that the indirect effect of the policy on the visitation distribution ℙ𝜋 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
yields a net zero contribution to the gradient. Consequently, the derivative isolates the state visitation
probability multiplied by the local derivative of the value function:
𝛿𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )
𝜕𝑉 𝜋 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
= ℙ𝜋 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
.
𝛿𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
𝜕𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )

Taking the partial derivative of 𝑉 𝜋 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) yields:



−𝛼 .
𝛿𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )

(13)

(14)

Finally, we evaluate this true derivative at the prior policy 𝜋 = 𝑝𝜙𝑘 . Three simplifications occur:
• The history visitation distribution matches the prior: ℙ𝜋 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) = ℙ 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ).
• The immediate KL penalty evaluates to zero: log 1 = 0.
• Because the policy perfectly matches the prior at all future timesteps, all future KL penalties evaluate to zero. Consequently, the regularized Q-function smoothly collapses to the unregularized
Q-function of the prior: 𝑄 𝜋reg ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎) = 𝑄 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎).
17

Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

Applying these simplifications yields:
𝛿𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )
= ℙ 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) ( 𝑄 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎) − 𝛼) .
𝛿𝜋 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) 𝜋=𝑝𝜙

(15)

𝑘

Since the functional derivatives of both 𝐽 and 𝐽¯ evaluated at 𝜋 = 𝑝𝜙𝑘 perfectly coincide, it follows that
∇𝜋 𝐽¯( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )| 𝜋=𝑝𝜙𝑘 = ∇𝜋 𝐽 ( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 )| 𝜋=𝑝𝜙𝑘 , concluding the proof.
□
Optimizing 𝐽¯. Optimizing 𝐽¯( 𝜋, 𝜙𝑘 ) w.r.t. 𝜋 for fixed 𝜙𝑘 has the well-known Boltzmann policy as
solution:
𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 )
𝜋∗ ( 𝑎 | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 ) =
exp ( 𝛽𝑄 𝑝𝜙𝑘 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎)) ,
(16)
𝑍 ( 𝑥 ≤𝑡 )
with the inverse temperature 𝛽 = 𝛼1 . We treat 𝛽 as a fixed hyperparameter defining a trust region
around 𝑝𝜙𝑘 where 𝐽¯ is a sufficiently accurate approximation of 𝐽 .
C.3. Comparison with MPO and Sequence-Model Value Estimation
While PPI shares the coordinate-ascent structure of MPO, it differs in how Q-values are obtained and
whether 𝜋 or 𝑝𝜙𝑘 is deployed as behavioral policy to gather trajectories. In standard MPO, 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝑎) is
typically represented by a separate neural network (a critic) trained via temporal difference (TD)
learning on the agent’s own experience, relying on the Markov property to condition on a single state
𝑠 instead of the full history.
ˆ 𝑝 ( 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎) is estimated via
In contrast, PPI leverages the sequence model as a world model. The value 𝑄
Monte Carlo rollouts performed within the sequence model itself. By sampling future trajectories
𝜏>𝑡 from 𝑝𝜙 (· | 𝑥 ≤ 𝑡 , 𝑎), the agent evaluates the expected return of an action based on its internal
representation of both the environment dynamics and the co-player’s predicted responses. This allows
PPI to benefit from the high-capacity temporal dependencies captured by the sequence model. Note
that PPI is easily extendable toward learning an explicit Q-value function conditioned on full histories
to amortize the cost of the MC rollouts and reduce variance.

D. Theoretical Analysis of the Equilibrium Behavior of PPI Agents
In this section, we analyze the theoretical properties of the Predictive Policy Improvement (PPI)
algorithm. Unlike standard reinforcement learning, where agents optimize a policy against a fixed (or
stationarily adapting) environment, PPI agents operate in a performative loop: the agent’s predictive
model determines its policy, which determines the data distribution, which in turn is used to update
the predictive model. This is closely related to the concept of “performative prediction” (Perdomo
et al., 2020), where the predictions of a model can affect the distribution of the very data it is trying
to predict (with traffic prediction models being a prominent example).
We formalize this interaction and define the concept of a Predictive Equilibrium (PE). We show that
while a global pure-strategy equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist due to the non-convex nature of
deep neural networks, a local predictive equilibrium (consistent with gradient-based optimization)
and a mixed predictive equilibrium (randomized strategies) are guaranteed to exist under standard
assumptions. Finally, we show that in the limit of a perfect world model, a predictive equilibrium
corresponds to a subjective embedded equilibrium (Meulemans et al., 2025b).

Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

D.1. Formal Setup
Consider a game with 𝑛 agents. Each agent 𝑖 maintains a predictive sequence model 𝑝𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) parameterized by 𝜃𝑖 ∈ Θ𝑖 , where ℎ𝑖 is a history 𝑥 ≤𝑖 𝑡 of arbitrary length 𝑡 , and Θ𝑖 is a compact metric space
(e.g., a bounded subset of ℝ𝑑 ).
The Performative Loop. The PPI algorithm (Algorithm 1) induces a closed-loop dependency between
parameters and data:
1. Model induces Policy: The agent derives a policy 𝜋𝜃𝑖 from its model 𝑝𝜃𝑖 via the policy improvement operator, defined in Eq. 6 (the Boltzmann policy over Q-values estimated via rollout).
2. Policy induces Data: When all agents interact using policies 𝝅𝜽 = {𝜋𝜃1 , . . . , 𝜋𝜃𝑁 }, they induce
a joint distribution over interaction histories ℎ. We denote the true probability distribution of
histories generated by the current joint configuration 𝜽 as ℙ(·; 𝜽).
3. Data induces Model: The agent updates 𝜃𝑖 to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between the observed distribution ℙ(·; 𝜽) and its model 𝑝𝜃𝑖 .
D.2. Predictive Equilibria
A stable point of this training loop is a configuration where the model optimally predicts the data
generated by the policy derived from that very model.
Definition D.1 (Global Predictive Equilibrium). A joint configuration 𝜽∗ = ( 𝜃1∗ , . . . , 𝜃𝑛∗ ) is a Global
Predictive Equilibrium if, for all agents 𝑖:

𝜃𝑖∗ ∈ arg min KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝜽∗ ) || 𝑝𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) .
(17)
𝜃𝑖 ∈ Θ𝑖

Intuitively, at equilibrium, no agent can improve their world model given the behavior induced by the
current joint models.
Challenges. Proving the existence of a global PE is difficult because the map 𝜃 ↦→ 𝜋𝜃 is complex
and the resulting objective is generally non-convex. The “argmin” set may change discontinuously
(mode hopping), preventing the application of standard fixed-point theorems. To address this, we
define two relaxed solution concepts: Local PE (relevant to gradient descent) and Mixed PE.
D.2.1. Local Predictive Equilibrium
In practice, PPI agents update parameters via gradient descent. They do not find global minima but
rather stationary points. Crucially, the update assumes that the data distribution is fixed (which can
be interpreted as a “stop-gradient” on the environment dynamics).
Definition D.2 (Local Predictive Equilibrium). Let Θ𝑖 ⊂ ℝ𝑑𝑖 be a compact, convex parameter space for
Î
each agent 𝑖 ∈ I. A joint configuration 𝜽∗ = ( 𝜃1∗ , . . . , 𝜃𝑛∗ ) ∈ 𝑖 ∈ I Θ𝑖 is a Local Predictive Equilibrium if,
for all agents 𝑖 ∈ I, the configuration satisfies the first-order stationarity condition with respect to
their local loss, assuming the data generating process is fixed. Formally:

This variational inequality definition corresponds precisely to the convergence criteria of projected

Theorem D.3 (Existence of Local Predictive Equilibrium). Assume Θ𝑖 is a compact, convex subset of ℝ𝑑𝑖 .
Assume the mapping from parameters 𝜽 to the local gradient of the loss 𝐺 𝑖 ( 𝜽) = ∇𝜗 KL (ℙ(·; 𝜽) || 𝑝𝜗 ) 𝜗=𝜃𝑖
is continuous. Then, there exists at least one Local Predictive Equilibrium.
Proof. We analyze the existence of a Local Predictive Equilibrium by framing it as a fixed-point problem.
Let L 𝑖 ( 𝜽, 𝜓) = KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝜽) || 𝑝𝜓 ( ℎ𝑖 ) denote the loss function for agent 𝑖, where the first argument 𝜽
determines the data distribution (fixed locally) and the second argument 𝜓 is the parameter being

optimized. Define the local gradient field 𝐺 : Θ → ℝ 𝐷 (where 𝐷 = 𝑖 ∈ I 𝑑 𝑖 ) as the concatenation of the
individual gradients:

A Local Predictive Equilibrium is characterized by the variational inequality ⟨𝐺 ( 𝜽∗ ) , 𝜙 − 𝜽∗ ⟩ ≥ 0 for all
Î
𝜙 ∈ Θ, where Θ = 𝑖 ∈ I Θ𝑖 .
We assume the parameter space Θ is a compact, convex subset of Euclidean space, and that the gradient
field 𝐺 ( 𝜽) is continuous. The continuity of 𝐺 follows naturally from the smoothness assumptions on
the predictive models 𝑝𝜃 and the induced policy distributions.
Consider the map 𝑇 : Θ → Θ defined by a projected gradient step:
𝑇 ( 𝜽) = ProjΘ ( 𝜽 − 𝜂𝐺 ( 𝜽)) ,

where 𝜂 > 0 is a scalar step size and ProjΘ is the Euclidean projection onto the set Θ.
1. Compactness and Convexity: By assumption, Θ is a compact and convex set.
2. Continuity: The map 𝐺 is continuous by assumption. The projection operator ProjΘ is nonexpansive and thus continuous. Therefore, the composition 𝑇 is a continuous map from Θ to
itself.
By Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem, there exists a point 𝜽∗ ∈ Θ such that 𝑇 ( 𝜽∗ ) = 𝜽∗ . This fixed point
condition implies:
𝜽∗ = ProjΘ ( 𝜽∗ − 𝜂𝐺 ( 𝜽∗ )) .
By the standard property of the Euclidean projection onto a closed convex set, this equation holds if
and only if:
⟨( 𝜽∗ − 𝜂𝐺 ( 𝜽∗ )) − 𝜽∗ , 𝜙 − 𝜽∗ ⟩ ≤ 0 , ∀𝜙 ∈ Θ .
Simplifying the terms inside the inner product, we obtain:
⟨−𝜂𝐺 ( 𝜽∗ ) , 𝜙 − 𝜽∗ ⟩ ≤ 0 =⇒ ⟨𝐺 ( 𝜽∗ ) , 𝜙 − 𝜽∗ ⟩ ≥ 0 ,

∀𝜙 ∈ Θ .

This inequality is precisely the first-order stationarity condition defined in Eq. 18, generalized to
the joint parameter space Θ. Therefore, the fixed point 𝜽∗ constitutes a Local Predictive Equilibrium,
rigorously accommodating both interior stationary points and boundary solutions.

D.2.2. Mixed Predictive Equilibrium
To guarantee the existence of an equilibrium without relying on local approximations, we can allow
agents to randomize over model parameters. This is analogous to mixed strategies in game theory.
Definition D.4 (Mixed Predictive Equilibrium). Let ΔΘ𝑖 be the set of probability distributions over
parameters Θ𝑖 . A Mixed Predictive Equilibrium is a tuple of distributions 𝝁∗ = ( 𝜇 ∗1 , . . . , 𝜇 ∗𝑛 ) such that
for all 𝑖 ∈ I:

𝜇 ∗𝑖 ∈ arg min KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) ,
(20)
𝜇 𝑖 ∈ ΔΘ𝑖



where 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) = 𝔼𝜃𝑖 ∼𝜇 𝑖 𝑝𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) , and ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) is the distribution of histories generated when each
agent 𝑖 follows the policy 𝜋𝜇 𝑖 obtained by applying the policy improvement operator equation 6 on
𝑝𝜇 𝑖 .
Theorem D.5 (Existence of Mixed Predictive
Equilibrium). Assume Θ𝑖 is a compact metric space1

and the map ( 𝜽, 𝜃𝑖′ ) ↦→ KL ℙ(·; 𝜽) || 𝑝𝜃𝑖′ is continuous for every 𝑖 ∈ I. Furthermore, assume that

Î
KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁) || 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) < ∞ for all 𝝁 ∈ Δ = 𝑖 ∈ I ΔΘ𝑖 . Then a Mixed Predictive Equilibrium exists.
Proof. We prove existence by constructing a continuous map on the space of mixed strategies and
applying a fixed-point theorem. Let ΔΘ𝑖 be the space of Borel probability measures on the compact
metric space Θ𝑖 . Endowed with the Wasserstein metric, ΔΘ𝑖 is a compact, convex metric space. Let
Î
Δ = 𝑖 ∈ I ΔΘ𝑖 be the joint strategy space.
Since ΔΘ𝑖 is a compact metric space, it is separable. We can fix a countable dense subset 𝐷𝑖 = { 𝜇˜ 𝑖,𝑘 }∞
⊂
𝑘=1
ΔΘ𝑖 .
We define the continuous advantage function 𝑎𝑖 : Δ × ΔΘ𝑖 → ℝ ≥0 as:
n

o

𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁, 𝜇 ′𝑖 ) = max 0, KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁) || 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) − KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁) || 𝑝𝜇 ′𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) .

Since KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁) || 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) < ∞, the advantage function is well-defined and evaluates to a finite real
number.
We now construct a transition map 𝑇𝑖 : Δ → ΔΘ𝑖 . Define a finite measure 𝐴𝑖 ( 𝝁) on Θ𝑖 that places
weights on the dense subset 𝐷𝑖 proportional to the advantage:
𝐴 𝑖 ( 𝝁) =

∞
∑︁

2− 𝑘 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁, 𝜇˜𝑖,𝑘 ) 𝜇˜ 𝑖,𝑘 .

𝑘=1

Í∞

Let 𝐴𝑖 ( 𝝁)( Θ𝑖 ) = 𝑘=1 2− 𝑘 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁, 𝜇˜𝑖,𝑘 ) denote its total mass. We define 𝑇𝑖 ( 𝝁) by mixing the current strategy
𝜇 𝑖 with the improvement measure 𝐴𝑖 ( 𝝁):
𝑇𝑖 ( 𝝁) =

𝜇 𝑖 + 𝐴 𝑖 ( 𝝁)
.
1 + 𝐴𝑖 ( 𝝁) ( Θ𝑖 )



Since the mappings 𝜽 ↦→ KL ℙ(·; 𝜽) || 𝑝𝜇 ′𝑖 are continuous and the spaces are compact, 𝑎𝑖 is uniformly
bounded and continuous in 𝝁 with respect to the weak-* topology. Consequently, the joint map
𝑇 ( 𝝁) = (𝑇1 ( 𝝁) , . . . , 𝑇𝑛 ( 𝝁)) is a continuous function from the compact convex set Δ to itself. By
Schauder’s fixed-point theorem, there exists a fixed point 𝝁∗ ∈ Δ such that 𝑇 ( 𝝁∗ ) = 𝝁∗ .
1 It is worth noting that we do not require the convexity of Θ

𝑖 in Theorem D.5, we only need compactness.

21

Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

We now prove by contradiction that 𝝁∗ is a Mixed Predictive Equilibrium. Let
𝐶 𝑖 = 𝐴 𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ ) ( Θ 𝑖 ) .

From the fixed point condition 𝜇 ∗𝑖 = 𝑇𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ ), we obtain:
𝜇 ∗𝑖 (1 + 𝐶 𝑖 ) = 𝜇 ∗𝑖 + 𝐴𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ ) =⇒ 𝐶 𝑖 𝜇 ∗𝑖 = 𝐴𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ ) .

Assume 𝝁∗ is not a Mixed Predictive Equilibrium. Then, for some agent 𝑖 ∈ I, there exists a distribution
𝜇
ˆ 𝑖 ∈ ΔΘ𝑖 such that



KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇ˆ𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) < KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇∗𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) .
Let





𝜖 := KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇 ∗𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) − KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇ˆ𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) > 0 .



By definition, the advantage of 𝜇ˆ 𝑖 is strictly positive: 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ , 𝜇ˆ 𝑖 ) = 𝜖 > 0.


Now since the mapping ( 𝜽, 𝜃𝑖′ ) ↦→ KL ℙ(·; 𝜽) || 𝑝𝜃𝑖′ is continuous, it follows that the functional


𝜇 ′𝑖 ↦→ KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇 ′𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) is continuous on the compact metric space ΔΘ𝑖 , and hence the advantage
function 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ , ·) is uniformly continuous. Therefore, there exists an open neighborhood 𝑈 ⊂ ΔΘ𝑖
containing 𝜇ˆ𝑖 such that 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ , 𝜇 ′𝑖 ) > 𝜖/2 for all 𝜇 ′𝑖 ∈ 𝑈 .
Since the set 𝐷𝑖 = { 𝜇˜ 𝑖,𝑘 }∞
is dense in ΔΘ𝑖 , there exists an integer 𝐾 such that 𝜇˜ 𝑖,𝐾 ∈ 𝑈 . Conse𝑘=1
∗
quently, 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁 , 𝜇˜ 𝑖,𝐾 ) > 𝜖/2 > 0. This strictly positive advantage guarantees that the total mass of the
improvement measure is strictly positive:
𝐶 𝑖 = 𝐴 𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ ) ( Θ 𝑖 ) ≥ 2 − 𝐾 𝑎 𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ , 𝜇
˜𝑖,𝐾 ) > 0.

From the fixed-point condition 𝐶 𝑖 𝜇 ∗𝑖 = 𝐴𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ ), and knowing 𝐶 𝑖 > 0, we can express 𝜇 ∗𝑖 as an infinite
convex combination of the basis measures in 𝐷𝑖 :
𝜇 ∗𝑖 =

Crucially, by the definition of the advantage function and the construction of the weights 𝑤𝑘 , any
weight 𝑤𝑘 is strictly positive if and only if the corresponding advantage 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝝁∗ , 𝜇˜𝑖,𝑘 ) > 0. A strictly
positive advantage exactly means that the evaluated measure achieves a strictly lower loss than the
current state 𝜇 ∗𝑖 :

KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇˜𝑖,𝑘 ( ℎ𝑖 ) < KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇∗𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) .

substituting this strict upper bound into the sum over 𝑘 yields:

KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇∗𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) < KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝝁∗ ) || 𝑝𝜇∗𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) .
Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. No such superior distribution 𝜇ˆ 𝑖 can exist, and the
fixed point 𝝁∗ is indeed a Mixed Predictive Equilibrium.
□
An interesting corollary of the above theorem, is that if our model is convex in functional space, then
there exists a pure global predictive equilibrium.
Corollary D.6 (Existence of Pure Predictive Equilibrium under Model Functional Convexity). Consider
the same assumptions as in Theorem D.5. Assume furthermore that for every agent 𝑖 ∈ I, the space
of representable predictive models { 𝑝𝜃𝑖 | 𝜃𝑖 ∈ Θ𝑖 } is convex. That is, for every 𝜃𝑖′ , 𝜃𝑖′′ ∈ Θ𝑖 and every
𝛼𝑖 ∈ [0, 1], there exists a pure parameter 𝜃𝑖 ∈ Θ𝑖 satisfying 𝑝𝜃𝑖 = 𝛼𝑖 𝑝𝜃𝑖′ + (1 − 𝛼𝑖 ) 𝑝𝜃𝑖′′ .2 Under these
conditions, a Global Predictive Equilibrium (in pure strategies) always exists.
Î
Proof. From Theorem D.5, there exists a Mixed Predictive Equilibrium 𝝁∗ = ( 𝜇 ∗1 , . . . , 𝜇 ∗𝑛 ) ∈ 𝑖 ∈ I ΔΘ𝑖 .
To establish the existence of a pure Global Predictive Equilibrium, we will demonstrate that for any
probability distribution 𝜇 𝑖 ∈ ΔΘ𝑖 , the model functional convexity
assumption guarantees the existence
 
of a pure parameter 𝜃𝑖∗ ∈ Θ𝑖 such that 𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ = 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 = 𝔼𝜃𝑖 ∼𝜇 𝑖 𝑝𝜃𝑖 .

We first prove this claim for finitely supported measures. Let 𝜇 𝑖 = 𝑚

Now, consider an arbitrary measure 𝜇 𝑖 ∈ ΔΘ𝑖 . Since the set of finitely supported measures is dense
∞
in ΔΘ𝑖 under the weak-* topology, there exists a sequence of finitely supported measures ( 𝜇 𝑖( 𝑚 ) )𝑚

converging weakly to 𝜇 𝑖 .
Because the mapping
𝜃𝑖 ↦→ 𝑝𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) is continuous and bounded for any given ℎ𝑖 , the functional
∫
𝜈 ↦→ 𝑝𝜈 ( ℎ𝑖 ) = 𝑝𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 ) 𝑑𝜈 ( 𝜃𝑖 ) is continuous with respect to the weak-* topology. Consequently, the
sequence of expected models converges pointwise: 𝑝𝜇 ( 𝑚) → 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 as 𝑚 → ∞.

From the inductive step, for each finitely supported measure 𝜇 𝑖( 𝑚 ) , there exists a corresponding pure

𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ = lim 𝑝 ( 𝑚𝑘 ) = lim 𝑝 ( 𝑚𝑘 ) = 𝑝𝜇 𝑖 .

This precisely satisfies the definition of a Global Predictive Equilibrium, proving its existence in pure
strategies under these conditions.
□
We remark that while the assumption of functional convexity is an idealization for finite-capacity
networks, deep neural networks are universal function approximators; consequently, as model capacity
increases, the space of representable distributions approximates the full convex set of valid probability
measures, rendering the existence of a pure equilibrium an increasingly accurate approximation.
D.3. Relationship to Nash Equilibria and Subjective Embedded Equilibria
Finally, we connect the fixed points of the PPI algorithm to the standard solution concepts of game
theory. In standard game theory, a Nash Equilibrium assumes that agents act optimally given a fixed
environment, where the policies of co-players are independent of the focal agent’s current action
selection. In contrast, agents in the PPI framework act optimally with respect to an internal world
model 𝑝𝜃𝑖 that estimates the joint distribution of future trajectories, thereby capturing potential
reactive dependencies between the focal agent’s actions and the co-players’ responses.
This is closely related to the concept of “Embedded Equilibria”, which characterizes the equilibrium
behavior that emerges from such self-predictive dynamics:
Definition D.7 (Subjective Embedded Equilibrium). (Meulemans et al., 2025b) A joint policy profile
𝝅∗ and a set of internal sequence models { 𝑝1∗ , . . . , 𝑝𝑛∗ } constitute a Subjective Embedded Equilibrium
if:
1. Subjective Optimality: Each agent’s policy 𝜋∗𝑖 is a strict best-response to its internal world
model 𝑝∗𝑖 .

24

Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

2. On-Path Consistency: Each agent’s world model perfectly matches the true environment dynamics exclusively on the equilibrium path (the distribution of histories ℙ∗ genuinely generated
by the joint policy 𝝅∗ ).
Crucially, a Subjective Embedded Equilibrium places no constraints on the accuracy of the agents’
models regarding off-path counterfactuals (actions that are assigned zero probability under 𝝅∗ ).
Nevertheless, 𝜋∗𝑖 must be a best response with respect to 𝑝∗𝑖 , and this takes into account counterfactual
off-policy paths. In other words, according to the predictive model 𝑝∗𝑖 , the agent 𝑖 will not get higher
expected returns by deviating from 𝜋∗𝑖 .
We refer the reader to Meulemans et al. (2025b) for further details about subjective embedded
equilibria and their properties.
It turns out that if PPI agents converge to a fixed point for which their (predictive) world models are
perfect, then the predictive equilibrium corresponds to a subjective embedded equilibrium. Let us
first formalize the predictive equilibrium with perfect world models:
Definition D.8 (Perfect Predictive Equilibrium). A Perfect Predictive Equilibrium is a configuration
𝜽∗ where the agents perfectly model the induced data distribution:


KL ℙ( ℎ𝑖 ; 𝜽∗ ) || 𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ ( ℎ𝑖 ) = 0 ∀𝑖 ∈ I .
(21)
Theorem D.9 (Perfect Predictive Equilibrium =⇒ Subjective Embedded Equilibrium). Consider predictive agents using the policy improvement operator defined in Eq. 6, where 𝜋𝜃𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) ∝ 𝑝𝜃𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) exp( 𝛽𝑄 𝑝𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 , 𝑎𝑖 )).
If 𝜽∗ is a Perfect Predictive Equilibrium, then the resulting configuration is consistent with a Subjective
Embedded Equilibrium.


Proof. At a Perfect Predictive Equilibrium, the condition KL ℙ(·; 𝜽∗ ) || 𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ (·) = 0 implies that the
sequence model matches the true data distribution almost everywhere. Thus, on the equilibrium path,
the prior action probability generated by the sequence model exactly matches the true behavioral
policy: 𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) = 𝜋𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ). This immediately satisfies the On-Path Consistency condition.
Substituting 𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ = 𝜋𝜃𝑖∗ into the policy improvement operator yields:
𝜋𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) =

1
𝑝 ∗
𝜋𝜃∗ ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) exp( 𝛽𝑄 𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 , 𝑎𝑖 )) .
𝑍 ( ℎ𝑖 ) 𝑖

For any action 𝑎𝑖 in the support of the policy (where 𝜋𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) > 0), we divide both sides by 𝜋𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 )
to obtain:
1=

1
ln 𝑍 ( ℎ𝑖 )
𝑝 ∗
𝑝 ∗
exp( 𝛽𝑄 𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 , 𝑎𝑖 )) =⇒ 𝑄 𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 , 𝑎𝑖 ) =
.
𝑍 ( ℎ𝑖 )
𝛽

Since 𝑍 ( ℎ𝑖 ) is a normalizing constant independent of 𝑎𝑖 , the expected return evaluated under the
model must be identical for all actions played with positive probability.
Now consider any off-path action 𝑎′𝑖 not in the support of the policy (where 𝜋𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎′𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) = 0). Because this
action is never taken under the joint policy, the marginal probability ℙ( ℎ𝑖 , 𝑎′𝑖 ; 𝜽∗ ) = 0. Consequently,
the KL divergence places absolutely no constraints on the model’s conditional predictions following 𝑎′𝑖 .
To formally verify Subjective Optimality, we demonstrate that there exists a valid completion of the
sequence model’s off-path conditional probabilities that justifies 𝜋𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎′𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ) = 0. Let 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛 = ( 𝑜, 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) be
25

Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference

an environment percept containing the minimal possible reward 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛 . We define the model’s off-path
counterfactual completion as 𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛 | ℎ𝑖 , 𝑎′𝑖 ) = 1, assuming absorbing minimal rewards thereafter.
𝑝 ∗

Evaluating the expected return under this completed subjective model yields 𝑄 𝜃𝑖 ( ℎ𝑖 , 𝑎′𝑖 ) = 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 , which
is not larger than the on-path return ln 𝑍𝛽( ℎ𝑖 ) . Because the policy operator is restricted by the prior
𝑝𝜃𝑖∗ ( 𝑎′𝑖 | ℎ𝑖 ), which must evaluate to 0 to satisfy the fixed point, the agent assigns exactly 0 probability
to the suboptimal deviation 𝑎′𝑖 . Therefore, the agent is playing an exact, best-response to its subjective
world model, fully satisfying the definition of a Subjective Embedded Equilibrium.
