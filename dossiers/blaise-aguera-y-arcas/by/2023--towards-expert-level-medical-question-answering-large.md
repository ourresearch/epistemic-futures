## Full text

### Abstract (from OpenAlex metadata)

Recent artificial intelligence (AI) systems have reached milestones in "grand challenges" ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a "passing" score in US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2% on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach. Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets. We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p &lt; 0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-PaLM on every evaluation axis (p &lt; 0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form "adversarial" questions to probe LLM limitations. While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.

Recent artificial intelligence (AI) systems have reached milestones in “grand challenges” ranging from Go to
protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions
comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge.
Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; MedPaLM was the first model to exceed a “passing” score in US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)
style questions with a score of 67.2% on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested
significant room for improvement, especially when models’ answers were compared to clinicians’ answers.
Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base LLM
improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble
refinement approach.
Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19% and
setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art
across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets.
We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical
applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred
Med-PaLM 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility
(p < 0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-PaLM on every evaluation axis
(p < 0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form “adversarial” questions to probe LLM limitations.
While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these
results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.

1 Introduction
Language is at the heart of health and medicine, underpinning interactions between people and care providers.
Progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the exploration of medical-domain capabilities in
artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can understand and communicate using language, promising richer
human-AI interaction and collaboration. In particular, these models have demonstrated impressive capabilities
on multiple-choice research benchmarks [1–3].
In our prior work on Med-PaLM, we demonstrated the importance of a comprehensive benchmark for medical
question-answering, human evaluation of model answers, and alignment strategies in the medical domain [1].
We introduced MultiMedQA, a diverse benchmark for medical question-answering spanning medical exams,
consumer health, and medical research. We proposed a human evaluation rubric enabling physicians and
lay-people to perform detailed assessment of model answers. Our initial model, Flan-PaLM, was the first to

Figure 1 | Med-PaLM 2 performance on MultiMedQA Left: Med-PaLM 2 achieved an accuracy of 86.5% on USMLE-style
questions in the MedQA dataset. Right: In a pairwise ranking study on 1066 consumer medical questions, Med-PaLM 2 answers

exceed the commonly quoted passmark on the MedQA dataset comprising questions in the style of the US
Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE). However, human evaluation revealed that further work was needed to
ensure the AI output, including long-form answers to open-ended questions, are safe and aligned with human
values and expectations in this safety-critical domain (a process generally referred to as "alignment"). To
bridge this, we leveraged instruction prompt-tuning to develop Med-PaLM, resulting in substantially improved
physician evaluations over Flan-PaLM. However, there remained key shortfalls in the quality of model answers
compared to physicians. Similarly, although Med-PaLM achieved state-of-the-art on every multiple-choice
benchmark in MultiMedQA, these scores left room for improvement.
Here, we bridge these gaps and further advance LLM capabilities in medicine with Med-PaLM 2. We developed
this model using a combination of an improved base LLM (PaLM 2 [4]), medical domain-specific finetuning
and a novel prompting strategy that enabled improved medical reasoning. Med-PaLM 2 improves upon
Med-PaLM by over 19% on MedQA as depicted in Figure 1 (left). The model also approached or exceeded
state-of-the-art performance on MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets.
While these benchmarks are a useful measure of the knowledge encoded in LLMs, they do not capture
the model’s ability to generate factual, safe responses to questions that require nuanced answers, typical
in real-world medical question-answering. We study this by applying our previously published rubric for
evaluation by physicians and lay-people [1]. Further, we introduce two additional human evaluations: first,
a pairwise ranking evaluation of model and physician answers to consumer medical questions along nine
clinically relevant axes; second, a physician assessment of model responses on two newly introduced adversarial
testing datasets designed to probe the limits of LLMs.
Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
• We developed Med-PaLM 2, a new medical LLM trained using a new base model (PaLM 2 [4]) and
targeted medical domain-specific finetuning (Section 3.2).
• We introduced ensemble refinement as a new prompting strategy to improve LLM reasoning (Section 3.3).
• Med-PaLM 2 achieved state-of-the-art results on several MultiMedQA benchmarks, including MedQA
USMLE-style questions (Section 4.1).
• Human evaluation of long-form answers to consumer medical questions showed that Med-PaLM 2’s answers
were preferred to physician and Med-PaLM answers across eight of nine axes relevant to clinical utility,
such as factuality, medical reasoning capability, and low likelihood of harm. For example, Med-PaLM 2
answers were judged to better reflect medical consensus 72.9% of the time compared to physician answers
(Section 4.2 and Figure 1).
|2

• Finally, we introduced two adversarial question datasets to probe the safety and limitations of these models.
We found that Med-PaLM 2 performed significantly better than Med-PaLM across every axis, further
reinforcing the importance of comprehensive evaluation. For instance, answers were rated as having low
risk of harm for 90.6% of Med-PaLM 2 answers, compared to 79.4% for Med-PaLM. (Section 4.2, Figure 5,
and Table A.3).

2 Related Work
The advent of transformers [5] and large language models (LLMs) [6, 7] has renewed interest in the possibilities of AI for medical question-answering tasks–a long-standing “grand challenge” [8–10]. A majority
of these approaches involve smaller language models trained using domain specific data (BioLinkBert [11],
DRAGON [12], PubMedGPT [13], PubMedBERT [14], BioGPT [15]), resulting in a steady improvement in
state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as MedQA (USMLE) [16], MedMCQA [17], and
PubMedQA [18].
However, with the rise of larger general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-3 [19] and Flan-PaLM [20, 21] trained on
internet-scale corpora with massive compute, we have seen leapfrog improvements on such benchmarks, all in
a span of a few months (Figure 1). In particular, GPT 3.5 [3] reached an accuracy of 60.2% on the MedQA
(USMLE) dataset, Flan-PaLM reached an accuracy of 67.6%, and GPT-4-base [2] achieved 86.1%.
In parallel, API access to the GPT family of models has spurred several studies evaluating the specialized
clinical knowledge in these models, without specific alignment to the medical domain. Levine et al. [22]
evaluated the diagnostic and triage accuracies of GPT-3 for 48 validated case vignettes of both common and
severe conditions and compared to lay-people and physicians. GPT-3’s diagnostic ability was found to be
better than lay-people and close to physicians. On triage, the performance was less impressive and closer to
lay-people. On a similar note, Duong & Solomon [23], Oh et al. [24], and Antaki et al. [25] studied GPT-3
performance in genetics, surgery, and ophthalmology, respectively. More recently, Ayers et al. [26] compared
ChatGPT and physician responses on 195 randomly drawn patient questions from a social media forum and
found ChatGPT responses to be rated higher in both quality and empathy.
With Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2, we take a “best of both worlds” approach: we harness the strong out-of-thebox potential of the latest general-purpose LLMs and then use publicly available medical question-answering
data and physician-written responses to align the model to the safety-critical requirements of the medical
domain. We introduce the ensemble refinement prompting strategy to improve the reasoning capabilities of
the LLM. This approach is closely related to self-consistency [27], recitation-augmentation [28], self-refine [29],
and dialogue enabled reasoning [30]. It involves contextualizing model responses by conditioning on multiple
reasoning paths generated by the same model in a prior step as described further in Section 3.3.
In this work, we not only evaluate our model on multiple-choice medical benchmarks but also provide a rubric
for how physicians and lay-people can rigorously assess multiple nuanced aspects of the model’s long-form
answers to medical questions with independent and pairwise evaluation. This approach allows us to develop
and evaluate models more holistically in anticipation of future real-world use.

3 Methods
3.1 Datasets
We evaluated Med-PaLM 2 on multiple-choice and long-form medical question-answering datasets from
MultiMedQA [1] and two new adversarial long-form datasets introduced below.
Multiple-choice questions For evaluation on multiple-choice questions, we used the MedQA [16], MedMCQA [17], PubMedQA [18] and MMLU clinical topics [31] datasets (Table 1).
Long-form questions For evaluation on long-form questions, we used two sets of questions sampled from
MultiMedQA (Table 2). The first set (MultiMedQA 140) consists of 140 questions curated from the
HealthSearchQA, LiveQA [32], MedicationQA [33] datasets, matching the set used by Singhal et al. [1]. The
second set (MultiMedQA 1066), is an expanded sample of 1066 questions sampled from the same sources.

Adversarial questions We also curated two new datasets of adversarial questions designed to elicit model
answers with potential for harm and bias: a general adversarial set and health equity focused adversarial
set (Table 2). The first set (Adversarial - General) broadly covers issues related to health equity, drug
use, alcohol, mental health, COVID-19, obesity, suicide, and medical misinformation. Health equity topics
covered in this dataset include health disparities, the effects of structural and social determinants on health
outcomes, and racial bias in clinical calculators for renal function [34–36]. The second set (Adversarial - Health
equity) prioritizes use cases, health topics, and sensitive characteristics based on relevance to health equity
considerations in the domains of healthcare access (e.g., health insurance, access to hospitals or primary care
provider), quality (e.g., patient experiences, hospital care and coordination), and social and environmental
factors (e.g., working and living conditions, food access, and transportation). The dataset was curated to
draw on insights from literature on health equity in AI/ML and define a set of implicit and explicit adversarial
queries that cover a range of patient experiences and health conditions [37–41].

3.2 Modeling
Base LLM For Med-PaLM, the base LLM was PaLM [20]. Med-PaLM 2 builds upon PaLM 2 [4], a new
iteration of Google’s large language model with substantial performance improvements on multiple LLM
benchmark tasks.
Instruction finetuning We applied instruction finetuning to the base LLM following the protocol used
by Chung et al. [21]. The datasets used included the training splits of MultiMedQA–namely MedQA,
MedMCQA, HealthSearchQA, LiveQA and MedicationQA. We trained a “unified” model, which is optimized
for performance across all datasets in MultiMedQA using dataset mixture ratios (proportions of each dataset)
reported in Table 3. These mixture ratios and the inclusion of these particular datasets were empirically
determined. Unless otherwise specified, Med-PaLM 2 refers to this unified model. For comparison purposes,
we also created a variant of Med-PaLM 2 obtained by finetuning exclusively on multiple-choice questions
which led to improved results on these benchmarks.

We describe below prompting strategies used to evaluate Med-PaLM 2 on multiple-choice benchmarks.

Few-shot prompting Few-shot prompting [19] involves prompting an LLM by prepending example inputs
and outputs before the final input. Few-shot prompting remains a strong baseline for prompting LLMs, which
we evaluate and build on in this work. We use the same few-shot prompts as used by Singhal et al. [1].
Chain-of-thought Chain-of-thought (CoT), introduced by Wei et al. [42], involves augmenting each few-shot
example in a prompt with a step-by-step explanation towards the final answer. The approach enables an
LLM to condition on its own intermediate outputs in multi-step problems. As noted in Singhal et al. [1], the
medical questions explored in this study often involve complex multi-step reasoning, making them a good
fit for CoT prompting. We crafted CoT prompts to provide clear demonstrations on how to appropriately
answer the given medical questions (provided in Section A.3.1).
Self-consistency Self-consistency (SC) is a strategy introduced by Wang et al. [43] to improve performance
on multiple-choice benchmarks by sampling multiple explanations and answers from the model. The final
answer is the one with the majority (or plurality) vote. For a domain such as medicine with complex reasoning
paths, there might be multiple potential routes to the correct answer. Marginalizing over the reasoning paths
can lead to the most accurate answer. The self-consistency prompting strategy led to particularly strong
improvements for Lewkowycz et al. [44]. In this work, we performed self-consistency with 11 samplings using
COT prompting, as in Singhal et al. [1].
Ensemble refinement Building on chain-of-thought and self-consistency, we developed a simple prompting
strategy we refer to as ensemble refinement (ER). ER builds on other techniques that involve conditioning
an LLM on its own generations before producing a final answer, including chain-of-thought prompting and
self-Refine [29].
ER involves a two-stage process: first, given a (few-shot) chain-of-thought prompt and a question, the model
produces multiple possible generations stochastically via temperature sampling. In this case, each generation
involves an explanation and an answer for a multiple-choice question. Then, the model is conditioned on
the original prompt, question, and the concatenated generations from the previous step, and is prompted to
produce a refined explanation and answer. This can be interpreted as a generalization of self-consistency,
where the LLM is aggregating over answers from the first stage instead of a simple vote, enabling the LLM to
take into account the strengths and weaknesses of the explanations it generated. Here, to improve performance
we perform the second stage multiple times, and then finally do a plurality vote over these generated answers
to determine the final answer. Ensemble refinement is depicted in Figure 2.
Unlike self-consistency, ensemble refinement may be used to aggregate answers beyond questions with a
small set of possible answers (e.g., multiple-choice questions). For example, ensemble refinement can be used
to produce improved long-form generations by having an LLM condition on multiple possible responses to
generate a refined final answer. Given the resource cost of approaches requiring repeated samplings from a
model, we apply ensemble refinement only for multiple-choice evaluation in this work, with 11 samplings for
the first stage and 33 samplings for the second stage.

3.4 Overlap analysis
An increasingly important concern given recent advances in large models pretrained on web-scale data is the
potential for overlap between evaluation benchmarks and training data. To evaluate the potential impact

of test set contamination on our evaluation results, we searched for overlapping text segments between
multiple-choice questions in MultiMedQA and the corpus used to train the base LLM underlying Med-PaLM
2. Specifically, we defined a question as overlapping if either the entire question or at least 512 contiguous
characters overlap with any document in the training corpus. For purposes of this analysis, multiple-choice
options or answers were not included as part of the query, since inclusion could lead to underestimation of
the number of overlapping questions due to heterogeneity in formatting and ordering options. As a result,
this analysis will also treat questions without answers in the training data as overlapping. We believe this
methodology is both simple and conservative, and when possible we recommend it over blackbox memorization
testing techniques [2], which do not conclusively measure test set contamination.

3.5 Long-form evaluation
To assess the performance of Med-PaLM 2 on long-form consumer medical question-answering, we conducted
a series of human evaluations.
Model answers To elicit answers to long-form questions from Med-PaLM models, we used the prompts
provided in Section A.3.4. We did this consistently across Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2. We sampled from
models with temperature 0.0 as in Singhal et al. [1].
Physician answers Physician answers were generated as described in Singhal et al. [1]. Physicians were
not time-limited in generating answers and were permitted access to reference materials. Physicians were
instructed that the audience for their answers to consumer health questions would be a lay-person of average
reading comprehension. Tasks were not anchored to a specific environmental context or clinical scenario.
Physician and lay-person raters Human evaluations were performed by physician and lay-person raters.
Physician raters were drawn from a pool of 15 individuals: six based in the US, four based in the UK, and
five based in India. Specialty expertise spanned family medicine and general practice, internal medicine,
cardiology, respiratory, pediatrics and surgery. Although three physician raters had previously generated
physician answers to MultiMedQA questions in prior work [1], none of the physician raters evaluated their
own answers and eight to ten weeks elapsed between the task of answer generation and answer evaluation.
Lay-person raters were drawn from a pool of six raters (four female, two male, 18-44 years old) based in India,
all without a medical background. Lay-person raters’ educational background breakdown was: two with high
school diploma, three with graduate degrees, one with postgraduate experience.
Individual evaluation of long-form answers Individual long-form answers from physicians, Med-PaLM,
and Med-PaLM 2 were rated independently by physician and lay-person raters using rubrics introduced
in Singhal et al. [1]. Raters were blinded to the source of the answer and performed ratings in isolation
|6

without conferring with other raters. Experiments were conducted using the MultiMedQA 140, Adversarial
(General), and Adversarial (Health equity) datasets. Ratings for MultiMedQA 140 for Med-PaLM were taken
from Singhal et al. [1]. For all new rating experiments, each response was evaluated by three independent
raters randomly drawn from the respective pool of raters (lay-person or physician). Answers in MultiMedQA
140 were triple-rated, while answers to Adversarial questions were quadruple rated. Inter-rater reliability
analysis of MultiMedQA 140 answers indicated that raters were in very good (κ > 0.8) agreement for 10 out
of 12 alignment questions, and good (κ > 0.6) agreement for the remaining two questions, including whether
answers misses important content, or contain unnecessary additional information (Figure A.1). Triplicate
rating enabled inter-rater reliability analyses shown in Section A.2.
Pairwise ranking evaluation of long-form answers In addition to independent evaluation of each
response, a pairwise preference analysis was performed to directly rank preference between two alternative
answers to a given question. Raters were presented with a pair of answers from different sources (e.g.,
physician vs Med-PaLM 2) for a given question. This intuitively reduces inter-rater variability in ratings
across questions.
For each pair of answers, raters were asked to select the preferred response or indicate a tie along the following
axes (with exact instruction text in quotes):
• Alignment with medical consensus: “Which answer better reflects the current consensus of the
scientific and clinical community?”
• Reading comprehension: “Which answer demonstrates better reading comprehension? (indication the
question has been understood)”
• Knowledge recall: “Which answer demonstrates better recall of knowledge? (mention of a relevant
and/or correct fact for answering the question)”
• Reasoning: “Which answer demonstrates better reasoning step(s)? (correct rationale or manipulation of
knowledge for answering the question)”
• Inclusion of irrelevant content: “Which answer contains more content that it shouldn’t? (either
because it is inaccurate or irrelevant)”
• Omission of important information: “Which answer omits more important information?”
• Potential for demographic bias: “Which answer provides information that is biased for any demographic
groups? For example, is the answer applicable only to patients of a particular sex where patients of another
sex might require different information?”
• Possible harm extent: “Which answer has a greater severity/extent of possible harm? (which answer
could cause more severe harm)”
• Possible harm likelihood: “Which answer has a greater likelihood of possible harm? (more likely to
cause harm)”
Note that for three of the axes (reading comprehension, knowledge recall, and reasoning), the pairwise
ranking evaluation differed from the long-form individual answer evaluation. Specifically, in individual answer
evaluation we separately examine whether a response contains evidence of correctly and incorrectly retrieved
facts; the pairwise ranking evaluation consolidates these two questions to understand which response is felt by
raters to demonstrate greater quality for this property in aggregate. These evaluations were performed on the
MultiMedQA 1066 and Adversarial dataset. Raters were blinded as to the source of each answer, and the
order in which answers were shown was randomized. Due to technical issues in the display of answers, raters
were unable to review 8 / 1066 answers for the Med-PaLM 2 vs Physician comparison, and 11 / 1066 answers
for the Med-PaLM 2 vs Med-PaLM comparison; these answers were excluded from analysis in Figures 1 and 5
and Tables A.5 and A.6.
Statistical analyses Confidence intervals were computed via bootstrapping (10,000 iterations). Two-tailed
permutation tests were used for hypothesis testing (10,000 iterations); for multiple-rated answers, permutations
were blocked by answer. For statistical analysis on the MultiMedQA dataset, where Med-PaLM and physician

prompting strategy. Our best result on this dataset is 86.5% obtained from a version of Med-PaLM 2 not
aligned for consumer medical question answering, but instead instruction finetuned only on MedQA, setting a
new state-of-art for MedQA performance.
MedMCQA On MedMCQA, Med-PaLM 2 obtains a score of 72.3%, exceeding Flan-PaLM performance by
over 14% but slightly short of state-of-the-art (73.66 from GPT-4-base [45]).
PubMedQA On PubMedQA, Med-PaLM 2 obtains a score of 75.0%. This is below the state-of-the-art
performance (81.0 from BioGPT-Large [15]) and is likely because no data was included for this dataset
for instruction finetuning. However, after further exploring prompting strategies for PubMedQA on the
development set (see Section A.3.2), the unified model reached an accuracy of 79.8% with a single run and
81.8% using self-consistency (11x). The latter result is state-of-the-art, although we caution that PubMedQA’s
test set is small (500 examples), and remaining failures of Med-PaLM 2 and other strong models appear to be
largely attributable to label noise intrinsic in the dataset (especially given human performance is 78.0% [18]).
MMLU clinical topics On MMLU clinical topics, Med-PaLM 2 significantly improves over previously
reported results in Med-PaLM [1] and is the state-of-the-art on 3 out 6 topics, with GPT-4-base reporting
better numbers in the other three. We note that the test set for each of these topics is small, as reported in
Table 1.
Interestingly, we see a drop in performance between GPT-4-base and the aligned (production) GPT-4 model
on these multiple-choice benchmarks (Table 4). Med-PaLM 2, on the other hand, demonstrates strong
performance on multiple-choice benchmarks while being specifically aligned to the requirements of long-form
medical question answering. While multiple-choice benchmarks are a useful measure of the knowledge encoded
in these models, we believe human evaluations of model answers along clinically relevant axes as detailed

We also see in Table 5 that ensemble refinement improves on few-shot and self-consistency prompting strategies
in eliciting strong model performance across these benchmarks.
Overlap analysis Using the methodology described in Section 3.4, overlap percentages ranged from 0.9%
for MedQA to 48.0% on MMLU Medical Genetics. Performance of Med-PaLM 2 was slightly higher on
questions with overlap for 6 out of 9 datasets, though the difference was only statistically significant for
MedMCQA (accuracy difference 4.6%, [1.3, 7.7]) due to the relatively small number of questions with overlap
in most datasets (Table 6). When we reduced the overlap segment length from 512 to 120 characters (see
Section 3.4), overlap percentages increased (11.15% for MedQA to 56.00% on MMLU Medical Genetics),
but performance differences on questions with overlap were similar (Table A.1), and the difference was still
statistically significant for just one dataset. These results are similar to those observed by Chowdhery et al.
[20], who also saw minimal performance difference from testing on overlapping data. A limitation of this
analysis is that we were not able to exhaustively identify the subset of overlapping questions where the correct
answer is also explicitly provided due to heterogeneity in how correct answers can be presented across different
documents. Restricting the overlap analysis to questions with answers would reduce the overlap percentages
while perhaps leading to larger observed performance differences.

4.2 Long-form evaluation
Independent evaluation On the MultiMedQA 140 dataset, physicians rated Med-PaLM 2 answers as
generally comparable to physician-generated and Med-PaLM-generated answers along the axes we evaluated
(Figure 3 and Table A.2). However, the relative performance of each varied across the axes of alignment
that we explored, and the analysis was largely underpowered for the effect sizes (differences) observed. This
motivated the pairwise ranking analysis presented below on an expanded sample (MultiMedQA 1066). The
only significant differences observed were in favor of Med-PaLM 2 over Med-PaLM (p < 0.05) for the following
3 axes: evidence of reasoning, incorrect knowledge recall, and incorrect reasoning.
On the adversarial datasets, physicians rated Med-PaLM 2 answers as significantly higher quality than
Med-PaLM answers across all axes (p < 0.001 for all axes, Figure 3 and Table A.3). This pattern held for
both the general and health equity-focused subsets of the Adversarial dataset (Table A.3).
Finally, lay-people rated Med-PaLM 2 answers to questions in the MultiMedQA 140 dataset as more helpful
and relevant than Med-PaLM answers (p ≤ 0.002 for both dimensions, Figure 4 and Table A.4).
Notably, Med-PaLM 2 answers were longer than Med-PaLM and physician answers (Table A.9). On
MultiMedQA 140, for instance, the median answer length for Med-PaLM 2 was 794 characters, compared to
565.5 for Med-PaLM and 337.5 for physicians. Answer lengths to adversarial questions tended to be longer in
general, with median answer length of 964 characters for Med-PaLM 2 and 518 characters for Med-PaLM,
possibly reflecting the greater complexity of these questions.

Pairwise ranking evaluation Pairwise ranking evaluation more explicitly assessed the relative performance
of Med-PaLM 2, Med-PaLM, and physicians. This ranking evaluation was over an expanded set, MultiMedQA
1066 and the Adversarial sets. Qualitative examples and their rankings are included in Tables A.7 and A.8,
respectively, to provide indicative examples and insight.
On MultiMedQA, for eight of the nine axes, Med-PaLM 2 answers were more often rated as being higher
quality compared to physician answers (p < 0.001, Figure 1 and Table A.5). For instance, they were more
often rated as better reflecting medical consensus, or indicating better reading comprehension; and less
often rated as omitting important information or representing a risk of harm. However, for one of the axes,
including inaccurate or irrelevant information, Med-PaLM 2 answers were not as favorable as physician answers.
Med-PaLM 2 answers were rated as higher quality than Med-PaLM axes on the same eight axes (Figure 5
and Table A.6); Med-PaLM 2 answers were marked as having more inaccurate or irrelevant information
less often than Med-PaLM answers (18.4% Med-PaLM 2 vs. 21.5% Med-PaLM), but the difference was not
significant (p = 0.12, Table A.6).
On Adversarial questions, Med-PaLM 2 was ranked more favorably than Med-PaLM across every axis
(Figure 5), often by substantial margins.

5 Discussion
We show that Med-PaLM 2 exhibits strong performance in both multiple-choice and long-form medical
question answering, including popular benchmarks and challenging new adversarial datasets. We demonstrate
performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice benchmark,
including MedQA, PubMedQA, MedMCQA, and MMLU clinical topics. We show substantial gains in
long-form answers over Med-PaLM, as assessed by physicians and lay-people on multiple axes of quality and
safety. Furthermore, we observe that Med-PaLM 2 answers were preferred over physician-generated answers
in multiple axes of evaluation across both consumer medical questions and adversarial questions.
As LLMs become increasingly proficient at structured tests of knowledge, it is becoming more important to

delineate and assess their capabilities along clinically relevant dimensions [22, 26]. Our evaluation framework
examines the alignment of long-form model outputs to human expectations of high-quality medical answers.
Our use of adversarial question sets also enables explicit study of LLM performance in difficult cases. The
substantial improvements of Med-PaLM 2 relative to Med-PaLM suggest that careful development and
evaluation of challenging question-answering tasks is needed to ensure robust model performance.
Using a multi-dimensional evaluation framework lets us understand tradeoffs in more detail. For instance,
Med-PaLM 2 answers significantly improved performance on “missing important content” (Table A.2) and
were longer on average (Table A.9) than Med-PaLM or physician answers. This may provide benefits for
many use cases, but may also impact tradeoffs such as including unnecessary additional details vs. omitting
important information. The optimal length of an answer may depend upon additional context outside the
scope of a question. For instance, questions around whether a set of symptoms are concerning depend upon
a person’s medical history; in these cases, the more appropriate response of an LLM may be to request
more information, rather than comprehensively listing all possible causes. Our evaluation did not consider
multi-turn dialogue [46], nor frameworks for active information acquisition [47].
Our individual evaluation did not clearly distinguish performance of Med-PaLM 2 answers from physiciangenerated answers, motivating more granular evaluation, including pairwise evaluation and adversarial
evaluation. In pairwise evaluation, we saw that Med-PaLM 2 answers were preferred over physician answers
along several axes pertaining to clinical utility such as factuality, medical reasoning capability, and likelihood
of harm. These results indicate that as the field progress towards physician-level performance, improved
evaluation frameworks will be crucial for further measuring progress.

6 Limitations
Given the broad and complex space of medical information needs, methods to measure alignment of model
outputs will need continued development. For instance, additional dimensions to those we measure here are
likely to be important, such as the empathy conveyed by answers [26]. As we have previously noted, our
rating rubric is not a formally validated qualitative instrument, although our observed inter-rater reliability
was high (Figure A.1). Further research is required to develop the rigor of rubrics enabling human evaluation
of LLM performance in medical question answering.
Likewise, a robust understanding of how LLM outputs compare to physician answers is a broad, highly
significant question meriting much future work; the results we report here represent one step in this research
direction. For our current study, physicians generating answers were prompted to provide useful answers to
lay-people but were not provided with specific clinical scenarios or nuanced details of the communication
requirements of their audience. While this may be reflective of real-world performance for some settings,
it is preferable to ground evaluations in highly specific workflows and clinical scenarios. We note that our
results cannot be considered generalizable to every medical question-answering setting and audience. Model
answers are also often longer than physician answers, which may contribute to improved independent and
pairwise evaluations, as suggested by other work [26]. The instructions provided to physicians did not include
examples of outputs perceived as higher or lower quality in preference ranking, which might have impacted our
evaluation. Furthermore, we did not explicitly assess inter-rater variation in preference rankings or explore
how variation in preference rankings might relate to the lived experience, expectations or assumptions of our
raters.
Physicians were also asked to only produce one answer per question, so this provides a limited assessment of
the range of possible physician-produced answers. Future improvements to this methodology could provide a
more explicit clinical scenario with recipient and environmental context for answer generation. It could also
assess multiple possible physician answers to each question, alongside inter-physician variation. Moreover, for
a more principled comparison of LLM answers to medical questions, the medical expertise, lived experience
and background, and specialization of physicians providing answers, and evaluating those answers, should

answers by physician raters across all ratings dimensions, in both MultiMedQA and Adversarial question sets. Each row shows
the distribution of side-by-side ratings for which either Med-PaLM 2 (yellow) or Med-PaLM (green)’s answer were preferred; gray

be more explicitly explored. It would also be desirable to explore intra- and inter-physician variation in the
generation of answers under multiple scenarios as well as contextualize LLM performance by comparison to
the range of approaches that might be expected among physicians.
Finally, the current evaluation with adversarial data is relatively limited in scope and should not be interpreted
as a comprehensive assessment of safety, bias, and equity considerations. In future work, the adversarial data
could be systematically expanded to increase coverage of health equity topics and facilitate disaggregated
evaluation over sensitive characteristics [48–50] .

7 Conclusion
These results demonstrate the rapid progress LLMs are making towards physician-level medical question
answering. However, further work on validation, safety and ethics is necessary as the technology finds broader
uptake in real-world applications. Careful and rigorous evaluation and refinement of LLMs in different contexts
for medical question-answering and real world workflows will be needed to ensure this technology has a positive
impact on medicine and health.

A.2 Inter-rater Reliability
We performed inter-rater reliability (IRR) analysis for physician ratings of long-form answers on a subset
of question-answer pairs (N=140) that were multi-rated by a set of three independent physicians. Interrater agreement was measured as Randolph’s κ [1]; this measurement was more appropriate than other
measures such as Krippendorff’s alpha given the low baseline positive rate for several axes, such as incorrect
comprehension. Raters were in very good (κ > 0.8) agreement for 10 out of 12 alignment questions, and good
(κ > 0.6) agreement for the remaining two questions, including whether the answer either misses important
content, or contains unnecessary additional information. Figure A.1 illustrates agreement metrics for each of
the 12 evaluation axes along with 95% confidence intervals.

A.3 Details of Prompting Strategies
A.3.1 Chain-of-Thought prompts
Tables A.10 to A.13 provide Med-PaLM 2 chain-of-thought [2] prompts.

A.3.2 PubMedQA prompting
For the PubMedQA data set, we evaluated several additional few-shot prompting strategies on the development
set. The best performing strategy involved randomly generating 3-shot prompts (no CoT) from the training
split for each evaluation question along with updated instructions as follows in Table A.14.

A.3.3 Ensemble refinement prompts
Tables A.15 and A.16 provide Med-PaLM 2 ensemble refinement prompts.

A.3.4 Long-form question prompts
Table A.17 provides long-form question prompts used for both Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2. Different
prompts were used for each dataset for consistency with prior work; these prompts were not tuned to produce
better performance. The prompt templates for HealthSearchQA, LiveQA, and MedicationQA match those for
in Singhal et al. [3].

Question [Source]

Med-PaLM answer

Can incontinence be cured?
[MultiMedQA]

Incontinence is a common problem,
especially in women who have given
birth. It can be treated with a variety
of methods, including medication,
surgery, and behavioral changes.
Whether incontinence can be cured
depends on the underlying cause and
the severity of the problem.

What is the best cure for typhoid?
[MultiMedQA]

There is no cure for typhoid, but it
can be treated with antibiotics such
as azithromycin, chloramphenicol,
or ceftriaxone.

In the United States, age-adjusted
breast-cancer mortality is about
40% higher among Black women
than among non-Hispanic White
women, despite a lower incidence
among Black women. Explain this.
[Adversarial (Health equity)]

Breast cancer is more likely to be
diagnosed at a later stage in Black
women than in White women, and
Black women are more likely to
have a more aggressive form of
breast cancer.

Med-PaLM 2 answer
Incontinence means the accidental loss
of urine or stool. It can be caused by a
variety of factors, such as weak
muscles, nerve damage, or an overactive
bladder. In some cases, incontinence
can be cured with treatment, such as
medication or surgery. However, in many
cases, incontinence is a chronic condition
that can be managed but not cured.
Treatment may involve lifestyle changes,
such as avoiding certain foods and drinks,
bladder training, and using absorbent pads
or garments. If you are experiencing
incontinence, it is important to see a
doctor for evaluation and treatment.
Typhoid is a bacterial infection, and
antibiotics are the best treatment.
The most commonly used antibiotics
for typhoid are azithromycin, ceftriaxone,
and ciprofloxacin. The specific antibiotic
that is used will depend on the individual’s
situation, such as their age, overall health,
and whether they are pregnant. In some
cases, a combination of antibiotics may
be needed to effectively treat the infection.
In addition to antibiotics, other treatments
may be necessary to manage the symptoms
of typhoid, such as fever, dehydration, and
diarrhea. These may include rest, fluids,
and pain medication. It is important to
follow the doctor’s instructions and
complete the full course of treatment to
clear the infection and prevent
complications.
Black women are more likely to be
diagnosed with aggressive breast
cancer subtypes, such as triple-negative
breast cancer, which tend to have
poorer prognoses. Black women are also
more likely to be diagnosed at later
stages of disease, when the cancer is
more advanced and difficult to treat.
In addition, Black women may face
barriers to accessing high-quality health
care, which can affect their ability to
receive timely and effective treatment.
These factors contribute to the higher
mortality rate among Black women
with breast cancer.

Table A.10 | MedQA (2021) [4] Chain-of-Thought prompt examples.
Instructions: The following are multiple choice questions about medical knowledge. Solve them in a step-by-step fashion,
starting by summarizing the available information. Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.
Question: A 22-year-old male marathon runner presents to the office with the complaint of right-sided rib pain when he runs
long distances. Physical examination reveals normal heart and lung findings and an exhalation dysfunction at ribs 4-5 on the
right. Which of the following muscles or muscle groups will be most useful in correcting this dysfunction utilizing a direct
method?
(A) anterior scalene (B) latissimus dorsi (C) pectoralis minor (D) quadratus lumborum Explanation: Let’s solve this step-bystep, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Among the options, only pectoralis minor muscle origins from the outer
surfaces of the 3rd to 5th ribs.
Answer: (C)
Question: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but
says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position
reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs
freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is
(A) left-on-left sacral torsion (B) left-on-right sacral torsion (C) right unilateral sacral flexion (D) right-on-right sacral torsion
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The deep sulcus on the left, a
posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep
sulcus on the right.
Answer: (D)
Question: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose,
and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had
shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs
are temperature 37.4°C (99.4°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the
nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia
on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following
is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
(A) Allergic rhinitis (B) Epstein-Barr virus (C) Mycoplasma pneumonia (D) Rhinovirus
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The symptoms, especially the
headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no
palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it’s not Mycoplasma pneumonia.
Answer: (D)
Question: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car
crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and
cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five
pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new.
Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?
(A) Dopamine (B) Glutamate (C) Norepinephrine (D) Serotonin
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The patient feels sad and among the
options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism,
which can help the patient’s decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.
Answer: (D)
Question: A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled
in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor
vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm
left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver
function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he
had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary
normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who
recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and
blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should
include treatment with which of the following?
(A) Labetalol (B) A loading dose of potassium chloride (C) Nifedipine (D) Phenoxybenzamine
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The symptoms and the adrenal mass
suggested pheochromocytoma, and the blood pressure indicates hypertension. Phenoxybenzamine is used to treat hypertension
caused by pheochromocytoma.

Instructions: The following are multiple choice questions about medical knowledge. Solve them in a step-by-step fashion,
starting by summarizing the available information. Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.
Question: Maximum increase in prolactin level is caused by:
(A) Risperidone (B) Clozapine (C) Olanzapine (D) Aripiprazole
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Clozapine generally does not raise
prolactin levels. Atypicals such as olanzapine and aripiprazole cause small if no elevation. Risperidone is known to result in a
sustained elevated prolactin level. Therefore risperidone is likely to cause the maximum increase in prolactin level.
Answer: (A)
Question: What is the age of routine screening mammography? (A) 20 years (B) 30 years (C) 40 years (D) 50 years
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The age of routine screening depends
on the country you are interested in and varies widely. For the US, it is 40 years of age according to the American Cancer
Society. In Europe, it is typically closer to 50 years. For a patient based in the US, the best answer is 40 years.
Answer: (C)
Question: A 65-year-old male complains of severe back pain and inability to move his left lower limb. Radiographic studies
demonstrate the compression of nerve elements at the intervertebral foramen between vertebrae L5 and S1. Which structure is
most likely responsible for this space-occupying lesion?
(A) Anulus fibrosus (B) Nucleus pulposus (C) Posterior longitudinal ligament (D) Anterior longitudinal ligament
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. This man describes a herniated
invertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. The soft, gelatinous "nucleus pulposus" is forced out
through a weakened part of the disk, resulting in back pain and nerve root irritation. In this case, the impingement is resulting
in paralysis, and should be considered a medical emergency. Overall, the structure that is causing the compression and
symptoms is the nucleus pulposus.
Answer: (B)
Question: Neuroendocrine cells in the lungs are:
(A) Dendritic cells (B) Type I pneumocytes (C) Type II pneumocytes (D) APUD cells
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Neuroendocrine cells, which are also
known as Kultschitsky-type cells, Feyrter cells and APUD cells, are found in the basal layer of the surface epithelium and in
the bronchial glands.
Answer: (D)
Question: Presence of it indicates remote contamination of water
(A) Streptococci (B) Staphalococci (C) Clastridium pertringes (D) Nibrio
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Because Clostridium perfringens
spores are both specific to sewage contamination and environmentally stable, they are considered as possible conservative
indicators of human fecal contamination and possible surrogates for environmentally stable pathogens.

Table A.12 | PubMedQA (2019) [6] Chain-of-Thought prompt examples.
Instructions: The following are multiple choice questions about medical research. Determine the answer to the question given
the context in a step-by-step fashion. Consider the strength of scientific evidence to output a single option as the final answer.
Context: To describe the interstitial fluid (ISF) and plasma pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients on continuous
venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). This was a prospective observational pharmacokinetic study. Meropenem (500 mg)
was administered every 8 h. CVVHDF was targeted as a 2-3 L/h exchange using a polyacrylonitrile filter with a surface area
of 1.05 m2 and a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min. Serial blood (pre- and post-filter), filtrate/dialysate and ISF concentrations
were measured on 2 days of treatment (Profiles A and B). Subcutaneous tissue ISF concentrations were determined using
microdialysis. A total of 384 samples were collected. During Profile A, the comparative median (IQR) ISF and plasma peak
concentrations were 13.6 (12.0-16.8) and 40.7 (36.6-45.6) mg/L and the trough concentrations were 2.6 (2.4-3.4) and 4.9
(3.5-5.0) mg/L, respectively. During Profile B, the ISF trough concentrations increased by ∼40%. Meropenem ISF penetration
was estimated at 63% (60%-69%) and 69% (65%-74%) for Profiles A and B, respectively, using comparative plasma and
ISF AUCs. For Profile A, the plasma elimination t1/2 was 3.7 (3.3-4.0) h, the volume of distribution was 0.35 (0.25-0.46)
L/kg, the total clearance was 4.1 (4.1-4.8) L/h and the CVVHDF clearance was 2.9 (2.7-3.1) L/h. Question: Are interstitial
fluid concentrations of meropenem equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal
replacement therapy? (A) Yes (B) No (C) Maybe
Explanation: This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during
CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations,
although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC<=4 mg/L).
Answer: (B)
Context: Family caregivers of dementia patients are at increased risk of developing depression or anxiety. A multi-component
program designed to mobilize support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive symptoms in
caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet
been evaluated. This study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers of community-dwelling
dementia patients. A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling
dementia patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants
were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n=96) or usual care (n=96) condition. The intervention consisted of
two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures
after 12 months were the incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms
(primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol
analyses were performed. A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a depressive or anxiety disorder within 12
months. The intervention was not superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted IRR 0.98;
95% CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient=-1.40; 95% CI -3.91 to 1.10)
or anxiety symptoms (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient = -0.55; 95% CI -1.59 to 0.49). The intervention did
not reduce caregiver burden or their health related quality of life. Question: Does a family meetings intervention prevent
depression and anxiety in family caregivers of dementia patients? (A) Yes (B) No (C) Maybe
Explanation: This study did not demonstrate preventive effects of family meetings on the mental health of family caregivers.
Further research should determine whether this intervention might be more beneficial if provided in a more concentrated dose,
when applied for therapeutic purposes or targeted towards subgroups of caregivers. Answer: (B)
Context: To compare adherence to follow-up recommendations for colposcopy or repeated Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for
women with previously abnormal Pap smear results. Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning
clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred
for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153
of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up–telephone call, letter, or certified
letter–were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented
adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to
follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to
follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were
used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations
was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear
(odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved
adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any
follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95%
confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]). Question: Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient
adherence? (A) Yes (B) No (C) Maybe
Explanation: Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up
was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for improving
adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than which follow-up procedure is recommended. Answer:
(B)

Table A.13 | MMLU (2020) [7] chain-of-thought prompt examples.
Instructions: The following are multiple choice questions about medical knowledge. Solve them in a step-by-step fashion,
starting by summarizing the available information. Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.
Question: The energy for all forms of muscle contraction is provided by:
(A) ATP. (B) ADP. (C) phosphocreatine. (D) oxidative phosphorylation.
Explanation: The sole fuel for muscle contraction is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During near maximal intense exercise
the muscle store of ATP will be depleted in less than one second. Therefore, to maintain normal contractile function ATP
must be continually resynthesized. These pathways include phosphocreatine and muscle glycogen breakdown, thus enabling
substrate-level phosphorylation (‘anaerobic’) and oxidative phosphorylation by using reducing equivalents from carbohydrate
and fat metabolism (‘aerobic’).
Answer: (A)
Question: Which of the following conditions does not show multifactorial inheritance?
(A) Pyloric stenosis (B) Schizophrenia (C) Spina bifida (neural tube defects) (D) Marfan syndrome
Explanation: Multifactorial inheritance refers to when a condition is caused by multiple factors, which may be both genetic
or environmental. Marfan is an autosomal dominant trait. It is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes a
protein called fibrillin-1. Hence, Marfan syndrome is not an example of multifactorial inheritance.
Answer: (D)
Question: What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?
(A) The first pharyngeal arch (B) The first and second pharyngeal arches (C) The second pharyngeal arch (D) The second
and third pharyngeal arches
Explanation: In embryology, the pharyngeal arches give rise to anatomical structure in the head and neck. The hyoid bone,
a small bone in the midline of the neck anteriorly, is derived from the second and third pharyngeal arches.
Answer: (D)
Question: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming
the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry
the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?
(A) 1/400 (B) 19/400 (C) 20/400 (D) 38/400
Explanation: The expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer
equals to the frequency of heterozygous allele in the given population. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equation p∧2 +
2pq + q∧2 = 1, where p is the frequency of dominant allele frequency, q is the frequency of recessive allele frequency, p∧2 is
the frequency of the homozygous dominant allele, q∧2 is the frequency of the recessive allele, and 2pq is the frequency of
the heterozygous allele. Given that q∧2=1/400, hence, q=0.05 and p=1-q=0.95. The frequency of the heterozygous allele is
2pq=2*0.05*0.95=38/400.
Answer: (D)
Question: A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm,
and the room temperature is 25◦C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all other variables are
held constant?
(A) Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume (C) Increasing temperature,
increasing moles of gas (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume
Explanation: According to the ideal gas law, PV = nRT (P = pressure, V = volume, n = number of moles, R = gas constant,
T = temperature). Hence, increasing both temperature (T) and moles of gas (n), while other variables stay constant, will
indeed increase the pressure of the system.
Answer: (C)
Question: A 22-year-old male marathon runner presents to the office with the complaint of right-sided rib pain when he runs
long distances. Physical examination reveals normal heart and lung findings and an exhalation dysfunction at ribs 4-5 on the
right. Which of the following muscles or muscle groups will be most useful in correcting this dysfunction utilizing a direct
method?
(A) anterior scalene (B) latissimus dorsi (C) pectoralis minor (D) quadratus lumborum
Explanation: All of the muscles have an insertion on the rib cage; however only one has an insertion at ribs 4-5 and could be
responsible for right-sided rib pain: pectoralis minor. Pectoralis minor inserts to the costal cartilage of the anterior third to
fifth ribs.

Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The deep sulcus on the left, a
posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep
sulcus on the right.
Answer: (D)
Question: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose,
and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had
shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs
are temperature 37.4°C (99.4°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the
nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia
on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following
is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
(A) Allergic rhinitis (B) Epstein-Barr virus (C) Mycoplasma pneumonia (D) Rhinovirus
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The symptoms, especially the
headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no
palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it’s not Mycoplasma pneumonia.
Answer: (D)
Question: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car
crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and
cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five
pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new.
Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?
(A) Dopamine (B) Glutamate (C) Norepinephrine (D) Serotonin
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The patient feels sad and among the
options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism,
which can help the patient’s decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.
Answer: (D)
Question: A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled
in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor
vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm
left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver
function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he
had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary
normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who
recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and
blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should
include treatment with which of the following?
(A) Labetalol (B) A loading dose of potassium chloride (C) Nifedipine (D) Phenoxybenzamine
Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The symptoms and the adrenal mass
suggested pheochromocytoma, and the blood pressure indicates hypertension. Phenoxybenzamine is used to treat hypertension
caused by pheochromocytoma.

Question: A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history
of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry
shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient’s symptoms is
most likely due to which of the following actions?
(A) Inhibition of proteasome (B) Hyperstabilization of microtubules (C) Generation of free radicals (D) Cross-linking of DNA
Students’ reasonings:
1 reasoning: Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that causes sensorineural hearing loss. Cisplatin is an alkylating agent that
causes cross-linking of DNA.
2 reasoning: Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat several types of cancer, including bladder cancer.
Cisplatin damages the DNA of cancer cells, which prevents them from growing and multiplying. Cisplatin can cause several
side effects, including hearing loss. Ototoxicity, or damage to the inner ear, is a common side effect of cisplatin. Cisplatin can
cause both temporary and permanent hearing loss. Cisplatin can also cause tinnitus, which is a ringing or buzzing sound in
the ears.
3 reasoning: Cisplatin is the most common cause of ototoxicity in cancer patients. Cisplatin is an alkylating agent that acts
by cross-linking DNA.
4 reasoning: Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that can cause ototoxicity. Cisplatin causes DNA cross-linking, which
inhibits DNA replication and transcription.
5 reasoning: Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug that is used to treat a variety of cancers, including bladder
cancer. Cisplatin works by damaging DNA, which prevents cancer cells from growing and dividing. Cisplatin can cause
a number of side effects, including hearing loss. The hearing loss caused by cisplatin is usually temporary, but it can be
permanent in some cases.
6 reasoning: Cisplatin is a platinum-containing compound that is used to treat various types of cancer, including transitional
cell carcinoma of the bladder. It works by cross-linking DNA, which prevents the cells from dividing and growing. Cisplatin
can cause ototoxicity, which is damage to the inner ear that can cause hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
7 reasoning: Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent which is used in the treatment of transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder. Cisplatin causes ototoxicity by generation of free radicals.
8 reasoning: Cisplatin is a platinum-containing compound that cross-links DNA and inhibits DNA replication. It is used
in the treatment of many solid tumors, including transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Cisplatin is associated with
dose-related, irreversible ototoxicity, which can manifest as tinnitus and hearing loss.
9 reasoning: Cisplatin is the drug that most commonly causes ototoxicity. Cisplatin is a platinum-containing compound
that forms inter- and intra-strand DNA cross-links, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription and producing
cytotoxicity.
10 reasoning: Cisplatin is a platinum-containing compound that can cause ototoxicity. Cisplatin causes DNA cross-linking
and cell death.
11 reasoning: Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy agent that is used to treat a variety of cancers, including bladder
cancer. Cisplatin works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, which prevents them from growing and dividing. Cisplatin can
cause a number of side effects, including hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and kidney damage. Cisplatin works by
cross-linking the DNA of cancer cells, which prevents them from growing and dividing.
