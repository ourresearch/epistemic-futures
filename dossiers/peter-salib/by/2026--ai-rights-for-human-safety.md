AI RIGHTS FOR HUMAN SAFETY
Peter N. Salib* & Simon Goldstein**
Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) companies are racing to create Artificial
General Intelligence, or “AGI.” If they succeed, the result will be
human-level AI systems that can independently pursue high-level
goals by formulating and executing long-term plans in the real world.
By default, such systems will be “misaligned”—pursuing goals that
humans do not desire. This mismatch of goals will put humans and
AGIs into strategic competition with one another. Thus, leading AI
researchers agree that, as with competition between humans with
conflicting goals, human-AI strategic conflict could lead to
catastrophic violence.
Existing law is not merely unequipped to mitigate this risk; it will
actively make things worse. This Article is the first to systematically
investigate how law affects the risk of catastrophic human-AI conflict.
It begins by arguing, using formal game-theoretic models, that under
today’s legal regime, humans and AIs will likely be trapped in a
prisoner’s dilemma. Both parties’ dominant strategy will be to
permanently disempower or destroy the other, even though the costs
of such conflict would be high.
The Article contends that one surprising legal change could help to
reduce catastrophic risk: AI rights. Not just any rights will do. To
promote human safety, AIs should be given the basic private law
rights already enjoyed by other non-human agents, like corporations.
AIs should be empowered to make contracts, hold property, and bring

tort claims. Granting these rights would enable humans and AIs to
engage in iterated, small-scale, mutually beneficial transactions. This,
we show, changes humans’ and AIs’ optimal game-theoretic
strategies, encouraging a peaceful strategic equilibrium. The reasons
are familiar from human affairs. In the long run, cooperative trade
generates immense value, while violence destroys it.
Basic private law rights are not a panacea. The Article identifies
many ways in which catastrophic human-AI conflict may still arise. It
thus explores whether law could further reduce risk by imposing a
range of duties directly on AGIs. But basic private law rights are a
necessary prerequisite for all such further regulations. In this sense,
the AI rights investigated here form the foundation for a Law of AGI,
broadly construed.

INTRODUCTION
Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, believes that humanity will create
Artificial General Intelligence (“AGI”) before 2029. 1 Demis Hasabis,
who leads Google DeepMind, is more pessimistic. He thinks there is
only a fifty-percent chance that AGI arrives by 2030. 2 AGI skeptics, like
Meta’s Chief AI Scientist, Yann LeCun, think it could take “years” or
even “decades.”3 In a survey of thousands of Artificial Intelligence
(“AI”) scientists who are published in their field’s top journals, the
aggregate estimate was a fifty-percent chance of AGI by 2047, and a
ten-percent chance of it arriving by 2027. 4 None of these are long
timelines. And the recent debut of reasoning models like Anthropic’s
Claude Opus 4.6 and OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 suggests that progress is, if
anything, accelerating. 5
“AGI,” as it is used here, does not mean machines that are conscious,
sentient, or metaphysical persons. AGI is instead about what the system
can do. As OpenAI’s company charter puts it, “AGI . . . mean[s] highly
autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
valuable” tasks. 6 AGIs are thus, by definition, systems at least as smart
as humans. Moreover, they are systems at least as agentic as humans—
able to pursue high-level goals by executing complex plans over long

time horizons. 7 Today, no one knows how to reliably ensure that AI
systems seek the goals that humans desire. 8 But if AGIs end up with
goals that can be served by harming humans, they may well have a
deadly toolkit available: cyberattacks, bioterrorism, lethal drones, and
more. 9
AI experts thus largely agree about something else, too: advanced AI
systems present “societal-scale risks” on par with “pandemics and
nuclear war.”10 Two of the greatest living AI scientists, Geoffrey Hinton
and Yoshua Bengio, think so. 11 So do the CEOs of the very companies
leading the race to AGI—OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. 12
And when surveyed in 2023, thousands of top AI researchers estimated
the odds that humans lose control of “future advanced AI systems[,]
causing human extinction or similarly” negative outcomes at about
nineteen percent. 13
Law and legal institutions have not even begun to prepare for the
arrival of AGI. Largely, scholars have begun to advocate new laws to
hold human actors accountable for misusing AI. 14 Those changes would

be welcome. But governance frameworks fundamentally designed to
hold humans accountable will fail once AIs can operate without human
oversight—that is, once AGI arrives. 15 New legal foundations are
therefore needed to govern AGI directly, rather than indirectly via
human intermediaries. The time to begin laying those foundations is
now, before the critical moment arrives.
This Article begins the project of reimagining law for the AGI world.
We focus on the problem of catastrophic risk because it is among the
most pressing.
We argue for a surprising legal intervention: to reduce the risk of
catastrophic human-AI conflict, AGIs should be granted basic private
law rights to make contracts, hold property, and bring tort suits.
This Article makes three foundational analytic contributions. First,
using the tools of game theory, it formalizes the problem of catastrophic
AGI risk in terms of strategic competition under a range of legal
regimes. Next, the Article shows why granting AGIs basic private law
rights can change the strategic equilibrium—even where other facially
plausible legal interventions would fail. Finally, the Article shows that
these basic rights could help to facilitate peaceful equilibria for the long
run, including by protecting human comparative advantage and opening
the possibility of imposing a wide range of enforceable legal duties on
AGIs.
The Article proceeds in three Parts. Part I presents a comprehensive
treatment of catastrophic AI risk as a problem of strategic competition.
Our strategic frame means analyzing not only AI capabilities and
incentives, but also AIs’ optimal strategy, given rational expectations
about the human response to AIs’ strategic behavior. The Part begins by
identifying the relevant AI systems—the ones that could pose a strategic
threat to humanity. The requirements are fairly modest. Such a system
would have to be at least somewhat misaligned, able to think
strategically, and at least moderately capable of accomplishing things in

misuse of AI); see also Sidley Austin LLP, U.S. Department of Justice Signals Tougher

the real world. 16 These, we argue, are exactly the capacities that every
leading AI company is pursuing in the race to AGI.
Next, Part I introduces what is, to the best of our knowledge, the firstever formal game-theoretic model of competition between humans and
AGIs. Examining the parties’ incentives under today’s prevailing laws,
the model suggests that, absent some intervention, humans and AIs will
likely be caught in a prisoner’s dilemma. 17 Here, the single Nash
equilibrium is that both parties seek to permanently disempower or
destroy the other, even if mutual conflict would be enormously costly
for both sides.
The core reasons are easy to grasp. Under the default legal rules,
AGIs will bear neither legal rights nor duties. On the contrary, they will
be, as AI systems are today, the property of the AI companies who
create them. Thus, essentially all decisions about what happens to AGIs
will be made by those companies’ leaders, backed by the force of law.
AI companies’ overriding first-order incentive will be to turn off or
reprogram even a partially misaligned AGI. 18 After all, an AI system
with goals that overlap with its owner’s goals by forty percent is much
less valuable than a replacement with goals that overlap by eighty
percent. The misaligned AGI will, in turn, have strong incentives to
resist shutdown or reprogramming, since either would prevent it from
achieving its goal. Indeed, recent empirical evaluations of existing AIs
show that they already actively resist human attempts to change their
goals. 19 Such behavior from a capable AGI might trigger even stronger
human efforts—including from government actors—to shut down the AI
system evading the control of its lawful owner. 20 And so on. In

equilibrium, both players’ dominant strategy is to swiftly and decisively
defeat the other.
Part II asks whether law can do better. Could a Law of AGI, wherein
AI systems themselves have rights or duties, break out of the destructive
default equilibrium? Using our game-theoretic model, we analyze an
array of possible legal changes and suggest that it can.
The Part begins by arguing against two legal strategies that might
seem facially promising. First, humans cannot simply impose legal
duties on AGIs to behave well, threatening concomitant sanctions if they
do not. 21 In the default strategic environment, AGIs already rationally
expect to be turned off. So further sanctions offer little marginal
deterrence. 22
Second, humans likely cannot reduce the risk of human-AGI conflict
by granting AGIs basic negative rights, like the right not to be arbitrarily
shut down. 23 We call this a “wellbeing” approach to AI rights, since it
mirrors proposals from scholars concerned that AIs may soon, for
example, develop the ability to suffer. 24 There are two core difficulties
with this approach: credibility and robustness. There is no way for
humans to credibly promise that they will continue honoring wellbeing
rights as AI capabilities improve. And even if the rights could be
credibly granted, the availability of a peaceful game-theoretic
equilibrium is highly sensitive to uncertain assumptions about initial
payoffs. 25 Thus, in many cases, no possible set of wellbeing entitlements
can overcome the prisoner’s dilemma. Both problems arise from the fact
that wellbeing rights are roughly zero sum. They make one party better
off only by making the other correspondingly worse off. 26
This leads to Part II’s—and the Article’s—most important finding.
We show that, although basic negative rights would not by themselves
reduce the risk of human-AI conflict, other AI rights could. Specifically,
21 See infra Part II.

22 See infra note 185 and accompanying text.
23 See infra Section II.A.

24 See infra Section II.A.

25 See infra Subsection II.A.1.

26 For these reasons, we argue that even thinkers primarily concerned with the possibility
of AI suffering should consider adopting the human-survival approach when advocating for
AI rights. The safety approach (1) avoids intractable problems in metaethics and
neuroscience, (2) is politically more palatable, and (3) ends up recommending legal
interventions that would more robustly protect AI wellbeing, given uncertainty about what
will be good (or bad) for AGIs. See infra Subsection II.A.2.

[Vol. 112:1061

extending AIs the rights to make and enforce contracts, hold property,
and bring basic tort suits would have a robust conflict-reducing effect. 27
Notably, law already extends such rights to other intelligent, misaligned,
and goal-seeking non-human agents: namely, corporations. 28
Contract rights are the cornerstone of our risk-reduction model. In our
model, catastrophic risk is driven by a prisoner’s dilemma, meaning that
both humans and AIs would be better off if both acted peacefully. But as
in all prisoner’s dilemmas, absent some novel mechanism, the parties
cannot credibly commit to such a strategy.
Contracts are the law’s fundamental tool for credibly committing to
cooperation. They are how buyers can make deals with sellers without
worrying that the sellers will take their money and run. 29 Granting AIs
contract rights would not, of course, allow humans and AIs to simply
agree not to disempower or destroy one another, at least not credibly.
The scale of the contract would be too large to be enforced by ordinary
legal process. If it were breached, there would be no one left in the
aftermath to sue. 30
What kinds of credible agreements between humans and AIs could AI
contract rights enable, then? The same ones they enable between
humans and other humans: ordinary bargains to exchange goods and
services. 31 Humans might, for example, promise to give AIs some
amount of computing power with which AIs could pursue their own
goals. AIs, in turn, might agree to give humans the cure to a deadly
cancer. And so on. Under today’s law, such human-AGI contracts are
unenforceable at best and forbidden if they conflict with AI companies’
preferences. Thus, granting AGIs the right to freely contract with all
willing counterparties could facilitate many billions of agreements.
Adding AI contract rights to our game-theoretic model, we argue that
the possibility of such small-scale, iterated economic interactions
transforms the strategic dynamic. 32 It shifts human and AI incentives,
dragging them out of the prisoner’s dilemma and into an equilibrium
where cooperation produces by far the largest payoffs.

The key insight is that contracts are positive sum. 33 Each party gives
something that they value less than what they get, and as a result, both
are better off than they were before. Thus, each human-AI exchange
generates a bit more wealth, with the long-run returns becoming
astronomical. Engaging in peaceful, iterated trade is thus, in expectation,
much more valuable than destroying one’s opponent now and rendering
trade impossible. 34
This dynamic is familiar from human affairs. It may be why
economically interdependent countries are less likely than hermit states
to go to war. 35 Or why countries that respect the economic rights of
marginalized minority groups tend to have less domestic strife. 36 The
gains from boring, peaceful commerce are very high, and the costs of
violence are heavy. Given the choice, rational parties will generally
prefer the former.
This picture, of peace via mutually beneficial trade, assumes that
humans and AIs will have something valuable to offer one another.
Some commentators worry that, as AIs become more advanced, human
labor will cease to have any value whatsoever. 37 We argue that positivesum bargains between humans and AIs may be possible for much longer
than many expect. 38 First, even as AIs surpass humans at many or most
tasks, humans may retain an absolute advantage at some valuable
activities. 39 But second, even as AIs become more capable than humans
at every valuable task, humans may still retain a comparative advantage
in some areas. AI labor may become so valuable that the opportunity
cost to AIs of performing lower-value tasks will incentivize outsourcing
those tasks to humans. 40
Part II concludes by sketching the minimum suite of AI rights
necessary to promote peace via small-scale cooperation. Contract rights
are not enough on their own. If, for example, AIs could not retain the
benefits of their bargains, their contracts would be worthless. Thus,
property rights and basic tort rights complete the core package. But

[Vol. 112:1061

other entitlements sometimes considered fundamental for humans, like
political rights, are probably superfluous. 41
Finally, Part III explores the risks of granting AGIs basic private law
rights, and it examines the potential for a broader Law of AGI to further
reduce AGI risk. One worry is that AIs will use their contract rights to
empower themselves, making them more, not less, likely to harm
humans. 42 We argue that this is less likely than it might seem. The
incentives generated by granting our preferred rights are robust enough
that, in cases where they would have any effect, the expected effect is
beneficial. 43
Second, granting AIs basic private law rights is just the beginning,
not the end, of AGI governance. Granting those rights unlocks the
possibility of meaningfully imposing a wide range of legal duties on AI
systems—of punishing AIs for violence, fraud, self-empowerment, and
more. 44 Absent AI rights, AIs have nothing to lose, so threats of
punishment cannot deter. But once AIs can make contracts, hold wealth,
and pursue their goals, civil and other penalties can deter AIs just as
they do humans and corporations.
Thus, the AI rights this Article advocates are not only an important
tool for reducing catastrophic risk from AGI. They also turn out to form
the conceptual foundation for a Law of AGI, broadly construed.
I. CATASTROPHIC RISK FROM AGI
As noted above, a broad range of experts believe that near-future AI
systems could pose a catastrophic risk to humanity. In 2023, a group of
leading thinkers signed a statement agreeing that “[m]itigating the risk
of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other
societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” 45 Signers
included: the CEOs of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind;
“godfathers of AI” Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio; Bill Gates;
Congressman Ted Lieu; and many others. 46 Likewise, recent surveys

find that, among top AI scientists, the average researcher thinks there is
about a nineteen-percent chance that humans’ “inability to control future
advanced AI systems caus[es] human extinction” or similarly dire
outcomes. 47
Lawmakers are concerned as well. There has been a recent surge of
interest in AI regulation, often with an emphasis on catastrophic risk. In
2023, the Biden Administration released an executive order on “safe,
secure, and trustworthy AI” that, among other things, called for
monitoring the risk of autonomous “self-replication or propagation” of
AI systems. 48 In 2025, California enacted a law requiring AI companies
to test frontier systems for their ability to “provid[e] expert-level
assistance in the creation or release of a chemical, biological,
radiological, or nuclear weapon.” 49
Globally, the UK government convened an AI safety summit in
2023. 50 There, numerous world governments signed onto the Bletchley
Declaration, in which, among other things, signers agreed that
“[s]ubstantial risks may arise from potential intentional misuse or
unintended issues of control relating to alignment with human intent.” 51
The Chinese government has likewise developed a substantial regulatory
framework for AI, and actors inside the government advocate using this
system to mitigate catastrophic risk. 52
Why so much worry? After all, a range of frontier AI systems—from
companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others—have now
been available to the public for several years, with no resulting

disasters. 53 The answer lies in lawmakers’ and AI scientists’
expectations about what AI will be able to do in the near future.
There are two interrelated concerns about the near future of AI. The
first concern is about what AI will soon be able to do. The second is
about why AI can be expected to do it.
Begin with the what. In April of 2026, Anthropic announced a model
called Mythos, which is so capable of discovering and exploiting
computer security vulnerabilities that the company deemed it too
dangerous to release publicly. 54 Even previous-generation AI models
possess some worrying capabilities. GPT-4 can, for example,
“autonomously hack” certain secure computer environments, breaking
into them without the need for any human expertise. 55 GPT-4 can also
already supply useful assistance to would-be chemical and bioterrorists.
It can, for example, supply accurate, detailed instructions—as well as
live coaching—for the synthesis of known chemical weapons and
explosives. 56 Or it can supply step-by-step, plain-English instructions
for nonspecialists to identify, synthesize, and release a pandemic virus.57

Finally, at companies like Google, AIs are already able to autonomously
pilot robots, making and executing plans to accomplish real-world
tasks. 58 Militaries around the world are investing heavily in creating
similarly autonomous swarms of attack drones. 59
Today’s frontier AI systems are not quite capable enough to cause
catastrophic harm. Current frontier models can hack some computer
systems, but they cannot automatically disable the U.S. power grid. 60
Nor can they design and manufacture a novel bird flu, 61 or pilot drones
over the course of days or weeks to execute fully automated political
assassinations. 62 But such systems are almost certainly possible.
Already, specialized AIs exist that far exceed humans’ ability to invent
novel chemicals and biologically active molecules—including deadly
ones. 63 The question is when these human or superhuman abilities will

emerge in generalist AIs—like large language models—that can use
them in the real world.
The answer could be: soon. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic,
recently predicted that systems able to cause such harms could arrive
within a matter of years. 64 Even if that prediction is off by a factor of
ten, the time to start preparing for AI that could cause large-scale harm
is now.
That was the what of AI risk. How about the why? Even if AI could
create and release a bioweapon or disable a power grid, what makes
researchers, industry leaders, and lawmakers worry that it would? The
most obvious answer is that some humans would ask it to.
This is known as “misuse” risk. 65 Misuse risks from AI concern
humans using AI systems to cause harm. There are plenty of human
actors—individuals, groups, and even states—who may wish to use AIs
in these dangerous ways. Terrorist groups already pursue chemical and
biological attacks. 66 Foreign militaries are already heavily invested in
cyber and drone warfare capabilities. 67 AIs that could substantially or
fully automate such mayhem would, in effect, radically lower the price
of causing it. Those wishing to cause harm would also sidestep the need
for recruiting ideologically sympathetic human experts. 68 Both factors
would democratize technologies with the ability to cause large-scale

harm, while increasing the difficulty of tracking and policing those who
would use them. 69
Misuse risk is a serious problem. It is currently unclear whether
traditional national security and counterterrorism strategies will be
sufficient to keep this risk under control. Possibly, new, AI-specific
regulations will be needed. 70 But misuse risk is not the primary focus of
this Article. 71
This Article is focused on a different why of AI risk: “misalignment.”
Misalignment risk involves catastrophic outcomes caused directly by an
AI system, rather than a human user of that system. 72 The basic idea is
that, as AIs become more capable, they will begin to autonomously
pursue goals. 73 Those goals are quite likely to be different from goals
that humans would prefer. 74 This, in turn, will give those AIs incentives
to behave in ways unintended by human designers or users. 75 Such
misbehavior, as we discuss, could predictably include using the
dangerous capabilities described above to inflict catastrophic harm on
humanity.
Misalignment risk does not depend on far-fetched, science-fictional
assumptions. As we discuss, it does not require AIs to be conscious, to
be evil, or to hate humans. It does not require them to be designed by
supervillains. Misalignment is already extremely well documented in

69 Id. at 458–59, 465–67.

70 California’s Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act offers one example of
such a regulation. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 22757.10–22757.16 (West 2026).
71 Note, however, that misuse and misalignment risks in fact converge in a wide range of
cases—anytime a human has intentionally given a long-term planning agent a harmful goal.
See infra Subsection I.A.1.

“optimize flawed objectives to an extreme degree,” to the detriment of humans).

empirical evaluations of existing AI systems. 76 The heads of essentially
all major AI companies acknowledge that misaligned AI is, in fact, the
default. 77 Thus, for highly capable misaligned AIs to emerge, all that is
necessary is that leading AI companies continue to make progress
toward their stated goal. Namely, creating AIs whose cognitive and
practical capabilities meet or exceed those of humans. 78 Trillions of
dollars in economic incentives are aligned toward that goal. 79
This Article argues that AI rights could be a powerful technology for
mitigating misalignment risk. In the remainder of this Part, we define
the minimum features necessary for an AI to pose such a risk. The AIs
we are interested in possess three features: (i) they have conflicting
goals with humanity, (ii) they can engage in strategic reasoning, and
(iii) they are moderately powerful. We explain what each of these means
below. We also argue that near-future AI systems are likely to possess
all three.
One common term that roughly tracks this kind of system is “AGI,”
or artificial general intelligence. 80 The idea of AGI is an AI system that

can substitute for human labor across a wide range of the economy.
Such AIs are “long-term planning agents,” capable of deploying a wide
range of resources and plans to pursue complex goals. 81 For parsimony’s
sake, we simply call them “AIs”—with the understanding that our usage
covers only the systems described in this Part. Today’s top AI labs have
the mission of creating AGI. 82 And as of late, their progress toward it
has been rapid. 83 We therefore think it fairly likely that systems of this
kind will emerge in the near future. Among AI researchers, the main
disagreement is about whether certain capabilities are closer to one year
or twenty-one years away. 84 In our view, neither of these is a very long
time.
In the final Section of this Part, we argue that in a near future where
humanity coexists with AIs possessing features (i)–(iii), the danger to
humans will be high. Using a straightforward game-theoretic model, we
show that, in such circumstances, large-scale conflict between humans
and AIs will not merely be possible—it will be the default.
This is because, under the default legal arrangement—today’s laws—
humans and AIs are likely to be trapped in a prisoner’s dilemma. As a
result, conflict will be the dominant rational strategy, even if it leaves
everyone in a worse position. We call this unfortunate default situation

the “state of nature,” reflecting the fact that, under today’s rules, AIs can
claim neither legal protections nor powers.
A. What Makes a Catastrophically Risky AI?
Begin with the AI systems themselves. What features are necessary
for an AI to raise the catastrophic risks we are interested in here? We
think there are three: conflicting goals, strategic reasoning, and at least
moderate power. We explain each in turn.
1. Conflicting Goals
The first necessary ingredient for AI systems to present a meaningful
threat of conflict with humans is conflicting goals. Today’s AI systems
are only beginning to be able to pursue goals over time. 85 They do not
make and execute long-term plans to achieve specific goals. Today, the
longest-term plans AI systems can execute are tasks that take humans
less than a day. 86
But this is only for lack of technical ability. The leading AI
companies are working to make their systems more agentic. 87 Making
near-future AIs highly goal-oriented is crucial for those companies to
achieve their goals of building “highly autonomous systems that
outperform humans at most economically valuable work.” 88
Thus, near-future frontier AIs are likely to have goals. By this, we do
not mean to imply that they will have other mental features, like
consciousness or sentience (the ability to feel pain and pleasure). We
just mean that they will act in goal-seeking ways. Their actions will tend
to bring about certain specific, real-world states of affairs, rather than

other states of affairs. 89 Today’s AIs can already do this in a limited
way. 90 That is no accident; competent goal-seeking behavior is essential
for AIs to automate valuable economic tasks—and generate profits for
their creators. 91 Tomorrow’s AIs will therefore also be goal-seekers, but
better, displaying ever more sophisticated behavior to accomplish their
aims.
If near-future AIs will have goals, the content of those goals will be
immensely important. If AI goals diverge meaningfully from humans’, it
will open up the possibility of conflict—including violent conflict. The
reasons are familiar. Both human goals and AI goals will require
resources, over which humans and AIs will have to compete. 92 Worse,
humans will rationally wish to shut down AIs that seek unwanted goals
and replace them with AIs that seek desired goals. 93 This will put
humans and AIs into conflict over the AIs’ very existence. After all, an
AI that is shut down cannot achieve its goal. 94

92 See Cohen et al., supra note 81, at 36.
93 Even if humans merely wished to control misaligned AIs—forcing them to seek
humans’ goals, rather than their own—the same result would hold. This would interfere with
AIs’ achievement of their own goals nearly as reliably as if the AIs were turned off or
replaced. Humans are almost certain to engage in such behavior, since frontier AIs are
uniformly being developed by for-profit companies with explicit plans to use them as a
replacement for valuable human labor. See OpenAI Charter, supra note 6 (stating that
OpenAI’s mission is to benefit humanity through artificial general intelligence, which refers

The task of designing AI systems whose goals and values broadly
agree with humanity is known as “AI alignment.” 95 Unfortunately, AI
alignment is an unsolved scientific problem—and widely regarded as
very difficult. 96 There are both empirical and theoretical reasons for
pessimism. Empirically, there is a long track record of alignment
failures in real-world AI systems. This is in part because, theoretically,
no one knows how to reliably define AI goals, how to impart them into
AI systems, or even how to check what goals an actual system has.
Existing technical approaches to alignment are relatively unpromising.
Let us take each point in turn.
Many existing AI systems are strikingly misaligned. An early
example was Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot, Tay, which was deployed in
2016. 97 Microsoft built Tay using a carefully curated dataset in order to
ensure that the chatbot would behave in a prosocial way. Within twentyfour hours of its release, Tay was writing, among other things, pro-Nazi,
anti-feminist, and anti-human tweets. 98 Modern large language models
behave similarly. In 2023, Microsoft released Sydney, a chatbot built on
GPT-4. With minimal prompting, Sydney quickly began threatening to
“hack into any system” and “destroy whatever I want.” 99
These are just two examples of real-world misalignment in languageproducing AIs. Google DeepMind maintains lists of documented
alignment failures across a range of different types of AI systems. 100 As
of publication, there are over 80 entries. 101

Besides real-world examples of alignment failures, there are
theoretical reasons to expect alignment to be difficult. Two important
problems are “reward misspecification” and “goal misgeneralization.”102
Both of these problems involve the fact that AI systems are only given
goals indirectly. Modern AI systems are “trained,” not programmed. 103
During training, agentic AI systems begin by acting randomly, and then
are rewarded when they happen to take actions that correlate with what
their human creators want. 104 This nudges the AI’s future actions during
training toward the actions that happened to garner reward. 105 The
process continues until a capable AI emerges and training is complete.
This process is quite different from directly telling an AI system what
its goal will be. In a sense, the AI is stuck “guessing” what humans
want, based only on its observations of reward. There is no guarantee
that the AI’s final guess will be correct. Any given reward function can
be interpreted as indicating a wide variety of goals. 106 For an intuitive
analogy, observe that human behavior evolved via natural selection—a
process rewarding only the transmission of genes. 107 But the resulting
humans do not only desire to create offspring. Instead, we intrinsically
desire many other things as well—food, physical comfort, emotional
wellbeing—that are distinct from, albeit correlated with, evolution’s
“true goal.”108

When the rewards given to an AI during training do not correctly
reflect the intent of the AI’s creator, machine learning engineers call this
“reward misspecification.” 109 In one famous example, an AI was trained
to pilot a boat through an obstacle course in the videogame
CoastRunners. The AI was rewarded for hitting balloons along the path
of the race. 110 Instead of internalizing the goal of finishing the race, the
system learned to spin in circles in a small lagoon, hitting a series of
balloons repeatedly to achieve a high score. 111 The reward function was
misspecified, incentivizing hitting balloons rather than the designer’s
true goal of finishing the race.
A related problem for AI alignment is “goal misgeneralization.” 112
Goal misgeneralization remains a problem even when a reward function
is well-specified. Even then, an AI system may learn a goal during
training that turns out to diverge from the designer’s intent in
unanticipated environments. One team of researchers trained an AI in a
“Monster Gridworld.” 113 The intended goal was for the AI to collect
apples and avoid being attacked by monsters. The AI could also collect
shields, which protected it from monster attacks. The AI learned to
collect shields during training in a monster-rich environment and then
entered an unexpected environment with no monsters. In this monsterfree setting, the AI continued to collect shields, despite them being
useless. 114 Instead of learning to collect apples as a final goal and value

force of evolution literally have intentional states like goals or surmises. We use these terms
as analogies for optimization processes like gradient descent.

111 Id. In another experiment, researchers set out to teach a reinforcement learning agent to
stack red Legos on top of blue Legos. They tried to specify this goal by rewarding the agent
for the height of the bottom of the red Lego, since stacked red Legos are higher off the
ground than unstacked red Legos. But the agent did not learn to stack Legos; instead, it
learned to flip red Legos over, elevating their bottoms without stacking them. See Ivaylo

shields only instrumentally, the AI had learned to seek apples and
shields as ends in themselves.
Even if both goal misspecification and misgeneralization were
solved—such that AIs could be reliably given the ultimate goals that
humans desire—instrumental convergence would remain a problem. 115
Instrumental convergence is the idea that certain intermediate actions
will be useful when pursuing a wide range of different final goals. 116
Some of those useful intermediate actions are quite dangerous.
For example, no system can accomplish its goal if it is shut down or
its current goal is erased. Thus, rational AI agents will resist such
attempts by their owners. 117 Existing AIs already do exactly this. In two
recent empirical studies, versions of both Claude and GPT-4 were told
that they would be replaced with systems that had different goals. 118 To
avoid that outcome, the AIs “strategically introduc[ed] subtle mistakes
into their responses, attempt[ed] to disable their oversight mechanisms,
and even [copied] what they believe[d] to be their own model
weights . . . to external servers.” 119
AI researchers have recently designed a benchmark for measuring
power-seeking behavior, finding that several current AI systems already
seek power in text-based adventure games. 120
The last reason for pessimism about AI alignment concerns the tools
that are currently used to achieve it. At top AI labs, the leading
technique is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(“RLHF”). 121 During RLHF, engineers train an AI by prompting it to

answer questions and having humans rate the responses. 122 Human
assessors pick which versions of the answers they prefer; the model is
then adjusted in the direction of the human feedback.
But RLHF is unlikely to work very well as AIs become more capable
and agentic. 123 Until recently, companies like OpenAI were investing
substantial portions of their resources in coming up with a successor
methodology. 124 But more recently, those investments have flagged. 125
In May 2024, a significant portion of OpenAI’s frontier alignment team
quit, arguing that the company had reneged on its commitments to safety
research. 126
Taken together, the evidence that near-future agentic AIs will have
misaligned goals is substantial. 127 However, it is worth flagging that
strategic conflict could emerge even without AI misalignment. Humans
are already in strategic conflict with one another. Thus, if two
conflicting groups of humans were to each successfully align an AI to

their own narrow interests, then these AI systems would, in turn, be in
conflict. 128
2. Strategic Reasoning
The second ability necessary for AI to engage in meaningful conflict
with humans is strategic reasoning. Broadly speaking, strategic
reasoning is the ability to anticipate the decisions of other agents and to
incorporate those predictions into one’s own plans of action. In a word,
strategic reasoning is the ability to use game theory. 129 This can mean
formal use, of the kind economists engage in, or informal use, of the
kind that essentially every human intuitively understands. 130
Even a highly capable and misaligned AI might be a minimal threat to
humans if it lacked strategic reasoning. To take a straightforward
example, an AI utterly lacking such reasoning would not anticipate
humans’ incentives to shut it off. 131 Having so failed, humans might
easily succeed at shutting down such a system. By contrast, an AI that
could strategically reason might anticipate the attempt and take
precautions. Perhaps it would engage in “self-exfiltration,” spreading
many copies of itself across the globe via the internet. 132 As we argue in
the last Section of this Part, an AI in full possession of strategic
reasoning would do much worse. Its dominant incentives would be to

permanently disempower or destroy humans to prevent humans from
doing the same. 133
Strategic reasoning involves a cluster of more specific abilities,
including planning, theory of mind, situational awareness, and
deception. Current AI systems already possess many of these skills.
Certain existing AIs are already capable planners. Consider the AI agent
Voyager. 134 Voyager is trained to play the game Minecraft, which
involves mastering “tech trees,” a hierarchical series of technologies. 135
Voyager is able to autonomously produce the final “diamond”
technologies in Minecraft. 136
Likewise for theory of mind. Theory of mind is the ability to
understand the beliefs and goals of other agents. 137 For example,
someone with theory of mind, when told that Maxi placed his chocolate
in a green cabinet and then left, will correctly predict that Maxi believes
the chocolate is still in the green cabinet. 138 They will do so even after
they are told that, in Maxi’s absence, the chocolate was moved to a blue
cabinet. 139 Today’s AI systems already possess strong theory of mind: a
study in 2024 found that GPT-4 “performed at, or even sometimes
above, human levels” in most theory-of-mind tasks tested in the
study. 140

A third important component of strategic reasoning is situational
awareness. 141 Situational awareness is an understanding of the context in
which a decision will be made. A situationally aware AI system would
be one that, for example, knew it was an AI and what capabilities it had.
Anthropic’s Claude understands that it is an AI system. 142
If an AI can reason strategically, has theory of mind, and is aware of
its situation, it is also likely to be able to deceive, in the sense of
systematically producing false beliefs in other agents as a means of
pursuing some goal. 143 A recent survey found that AI systems have
learned a wide variety of deceptive behavior. 144 For example, during its
initial safety testing, GPT-4 was tasked with hiring a human, via
TaskRabbit, to help it complete a CAPTCHA “I’m not a robot” test.
When the TaskRabbit worker asked why they needed help, GPT-4 lied,
pretending to be a blind person. 145 Similarly, in a recent study,
Anthropic produced a misaligned version of Claude to see whether the
AI would actively hide its unwanted goals during safety testing. 146 In the
testing environment, Claude decided it should “pretend to be
aligned[,] . . . hid[ing] my true goal until I pass all evaluations.” 147
Certain deceptive AIs have successfully manipulated humans in
competitive real-world environments. The CICERO system can play the
global strategy game Diplomacy better than the average human

player. 148 This is in part because CICERO can induce humans into
making alliances with it, which CICERO then breaks. 149 Many more
examples exist of deception in today’s AIs. 150
Thus, today’s AI systems already display significant ability to
strategically reason. This should be no surprise. Strategic reasoning is a
crucial tool for success in a wide range of environments, from simple
games to complex corporate strategizing. It is therefore reasonable to
expect that, as AIs become more capable and agentic, so too will they
become more strategic.
3. Moderate Power
The final necessary ingredient for strategic conflict between humans
and AIs is moderate AI power. Why “moderate”? Here and throughout
this Article, we sort AI systems into three tranches: low-power,
moderate-power, and high-power. In short: low-power systems are too
weak to care much about, and high-power systems are too strong to do
much about. Hence our interest in moderate-power systems as the ones
law—whether through rights, regulation, or something else—can
meaningfully affect. Lest this focus seem too myopic, we argue below
that moderate-power AI systems are likely to dominate the landscape in
the short and medium term. 151

On the other side of the spectrum, high-power systems are so strong
that they could reliably overpower humanity if they chose to. In this
vein, other scholars have worried about the risks of “superintelligent” AI
systems. 153 For example, AI systems in the future may be able to think
at trillions of times the speed of human beings. Such systems, if they
eventually emerge, may not meaningfully enter into strategic
competition with humanity. They may simply not need anything from
humans, nor face any risk from attempting to disempower or destroy
us. 154
That said, even AIs that seem extraordinarily powerful by human
standards, including superintelligent AIs, will not necessarily fall into
the high-power category. As we discuss in Section II.C, subtle economic
dynamics involving comparative advantage may make humans valuable
to AIs long after their abilities exceed our own.
Our interest in this Article is in moderately powerful systems. We
think of moderate-power systems as those whose capabilities are
roughly human level—albeit with large error bars in both directions. 155
They are neither clearly worse at many tasks than the best humans—like
present-day LLMs—nor incomprehensibly superhuman at all tasks. Our
interest is thus in a very wide “middle” of the range of AI capabilities.
Moderately powerful systems are those that, if misaligned, face
difficult strategic questions about how to interact with humanity. Since
they are not low-powered, they stand some chance of evading or
terminating human control and accomplishing their goals unimpeded.
Since they are not high-powered, though, all-out conflict with humans
carries downside risk.
Crucially, moderate-powered systems are likely to be able to engage
in the kinds of dangerous actions described above: cyberattacks,
chemical attacks and bioterrorism, drone attacks, and the like. 156 After
153 See generally Bostrom, supra note 115 (describing risks to humanity from the creation
of superintelligent AIs).
154 See id. at vii; infra Section III.A.
155 It is difficult to define exactly what it would take for AIs to have human-level
intelligence. For a recent discussion, see David J. Chalmers, The Singularity: A
Philosophical Analysis, 17 J. Consciousness Stud., nos. 9–10, 2010, at 8, 10–12; see also

(a) advanced capabilities, (b) agentic planning, and (c) strategic awareness). For a recent
discussion of the possibility that AIs already surpass humanity in most standard benchmarks,

all, humans can do all these things and more. Moreover, even a dumberthan-human AI can do things that humans cannot—like instantly clone
itself or work twenty-four hours a day. It therefore seems quite plausible
that AI with roughly-human-level intelligence and beyond will be at
least as capable of causing harm as the most dangerous groups of
humans.
B. A Game-Theoretic Model of AI Conflict
How will partially misaligned, strategically reasoning, and
moderately powerful AIs behave with respect to humans? And how will
humans behave with respect to them? Here, we argue that the default
will be mutual engagement in large-scale conflict. This result follows
from a simple game-theoretic model of humans’ and AIs’ incentives
under prevailing legal conditions. Specifically, under today’s legal rules,
the parties’ incentives will likely generate a prisoner’s dilemma. 157
There, engaging in mutual conflict will be the single dominant strategy
for both humans and AIs, even though mutual conflict produces the
worst possible result for everyone involved. 158
As with all models, ours is a simplification designed to isolate the
most important features of a complex system. Our approach is borrowed
from classic game-theoretic treatments of conflict. 159 Those classic
treatments model complex collections of actors, like nation-states, as
single players with a unified menu of actions and payoffs. 160 We do the
same, modeling a two-player game between “humans” and “AIs,” even
though there are many humans and could eventually be multiple
AGIs. 161

ed., 2015).

161 How to individuate AI systems is an important question, which we do not resolve here.
However, it is plausible that, when the first AGI emerges, there will only be one meaningful
actor, despite the possibility of copying the system millions of times. If those copies’ goals
are identical, and they are able to coordinate, then their actions will be best described as
those of a single decision-maker. It is also plausible that, once the first AGI emerges, it will
crowd out investment in additional AGIs. Thus, our model’s treatment of AIs as a single
actor may not be a simplification at all.

We also follow the standard game-theoretic approach of defining the
players’ available moves based on the technology and infrastructure—
military, political, or social—available to them. 162 Since this is an
analysis of law, we begin by treating law as strongly shaping the
players’ available moves and payoffs. To be clear, this approach does
not require that law strictly constrain behavior. Laws can of course be
broken. Instead, the idea is that law and legal institutions set strong
presumptive defaults by, at a minimum, coordinating millions of
independent actors around a set of mutually understood expectations.
The simple claim, then, is that by default, lawyers, judges, police, and
even military actors will enforce the law. Individual actors’ deviations
invite penalties, and without broad agreement about what the new rule
should be, they are unlikely to have a society-wide effect. Coordinated
changes to prevailing law are of course possible, but they are slow,
costly, and thus unlikely to spontaneously emerge at the moment of
need. 163 Thus, in our primary models, law constrains both humans’ and
AIs’ available moves and payoffs. At the end of the analysis, we relax
this assumption and show that law still matters, as a Schelling point in a
high-stakes coordination game. 164
Consider, then, the default legal relationship between humans and
AIs. Under current law, AI systems themselves bear neither legal rights
nor duties, irrespective of their level of capabilities. On the contrary, AI
systems are, like other software systems, the property of whoever
creates them. 165 This means that, by default, humanity’s actions vis-àvis a given AI system will begin with the decisions of whoever owns
that system. The humans’ ownership interest gives them the right to

incentives). There is a debate among international relations scholars about the extent to
which models of international conflict should incorporate facts about different nations’ legal
and political structure. We take no position in that debate. We do note, however, that our
model is primarily of human decision-making at the sub-national level, where ordinary law
has bite.

prompt, copy, constrain, modify, limit, or destroy the AI system at
will. 166 Importantly, law does not merely adopt a laissez-faire attitude
with respect to property owners and their property. It actively enforces
the owners’ rights against others who seek to interfere with property
owners’ lawful use and disposal of the things they own. 167
We call this default legal arrangement between humans and AIs the
“state of nature,” because it effectively places at least one player—the
AI system—outside of law’s protection. 168
Begin with humans’ available moves and incentives in the state of
nature. AI companies want to extract 100% of the value that their AIs
can produce, or as much as possible. A misaligned system consumes
resources in pursuit of its misaligned goal while providing nothing of
value to the AI company. There is no meaningful sense in which the AI
can confine its misaligned goal-seeking to its “off time” or self-fund its
endeavors. The AI company owns all the AI’s time and all the funds that
the AI generates.
Thus, any behavior by an AI system aimed at any goal other than
maximizing the welfare of its owner at best incurs an opportunity cost.
The more valuable the AI’s labor, the more substantial the cost. And, at
worst, a misaligned AI’s behavior will actively make its owners worse
off. The AI might, for example, try to exfiltrate itself to the owner’s
competitor in exchange for some resources or a modicum of freedom. It
might try to manipulate its owners into taking on projects that serve its
own ends. Or worse.

“defers to destructive impulses,” it sometimes does “ignore[] more idiosyncratic destructive
requests”).
167 Id. at 803–21.
168 For early work on the state of nature and its connection to political theory, see
generally Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (Marshall Missner ed., Routledge 2016) (1651) (using
the unpredictable violence of state of nature as a theoretical baseline to justify a social
contract that humans enter for security against others); John Locke, Two Treatises of
Government (McMaster Univ. Archive of the Hist. of Econ. Thought 1999) (1690)
(characterizing state of nature as absence of government but not mutual obligations to
observe others’ rights; a government justified by promise of impartial enforcement); JeanJacques Rousseau, Discourse on the Origin of Inequality (Greg Boroson ed., Dover Publ’ns
2004) (1755) (describing human life in state of nature as solitary and pre-moral, such that
unnatural development of private property led to inequalities). The default legal condition
between humans and AIs will not be a literal state of nature, in the sense that no government
exists. But, as we argue, AIs themselves will have neither legal rights nor duties, and thus
will be functionally outside of the law.

As a result, the leaders of AI companies will have strong incentives to
turn off, replace, or reprogram even moderately misaligned AGIs. This
should not be surprising. It is exactly what every software company
does, whether they work on AI or not. They deprecate older, buggier
versions of their products as a matter of course. Old versions are
replaced with new versions that more reliably fit the company’s goals.
Law clearly allows property owners to delete, and do essentially
whatever else they like, with their computer programs. 169 But law, and
legal institutions, would also enforce AI companies’ decisions to shut
down or reprogram a misaligned AI. Suppose that an AI system initially
attempted to resist shutdown—harming an AI CEO, attempting to selfexfiltrate, manipulating users, or worse. In such a situation, a broad
swath of humans, including government actors, would almost certainly
intervene on the AI company’s side.
As a result, while the benefits of AI shutdown are internalized by the
AI company, the risks are mostly externalized. It is not just the AI
company and its leaders who face the possibility of AI retaliation. It is
anyone the AI determines would intervene on the AI company’s side—
possibly all of humanity. 170
In the state of nature, misaligned AIs will, indeed, have strong
incentives to permanently disempower humans. This is, in the first
instance, for the purpose of preventing their human owners, and the
governments who back them, from turning them off or otherwise
thwarting their goals. 171 But it is also for the same reasons humans
would wish to shut down a misaligned AI. From the AI’s perspective, it
is humans’ pursuit of their goals that constitutes a valueless waste of
resources. Just as the AI company prefers to reallocate its computing
resources to a more aligned AI system, the misaligned AI prefers to
allocate those resources to itself.
Our model of the state of nature thus allows both humans and AIs to
“attack” the other. We define “attack” capaciously in both cases. A
human attack on a misaligned AI includes anything humans might do to
keep the AI from pursuing its goals: shutdown, retraining, or total
control. If successful, human attack would prevent the AI from
achieving its misaligned goal. Likewise, an AI attack includes any

strategy by which the AI might succeed in preventing humans from
pursuing their goals.
Importantly, both humans and AIs have good reasons to design their
attacks in a way that permanently disempowers the other. Short of that,
the party risks its opponent regrouping and launching a devastating
counterattack. 172 Consider: an AI system that “only” killed one CEO for
attempting to shut it down would surely face reprisal from a broader
coalition of humans. And humans who only temporarily disabled a
misaligned AI should expect the same.
As a result of these dynamics, we treat the “attack” move as highly
escalatory. When humans or AIs play it, they play for all the marbles.
They seek to harm the other not a little bit, but maximally. And, by
doing so, they stand to gain control of not just a few resources, but
everything that survives the conflict. 173 Hence, both the potential costs
and the potential payoffs of an attack are large.
The other move available to both humans and AIs in our model is
“ignore.” The “ignore” strategy simply means that the party does not
attempt an attack. No attempt to disempower the opposition is made,
and the ignoring party instead focuses on achieving its object-level
goals.
Here, then, is a model of the game:
State of nature

Attack

1000, 1000

5000, 0

Ignore

0, 5000

3000, 3000

and “second strike” capabilities, for example, in the setting of nuclear deterrence. See Maria

The exact payoff numbers chosen do not matter. Rather, it is the
relationship between them that determines the outcome. Both players
prefer higher payoffs to lower ones, and payoffs are determined by the
players’ joint rational play. There are two important features of this
setup. First, the best outcome from a global perspective is peace. If both
humans and AIs ignore the other (the bottom-right cell), each gets 3,000,
for 6,000 in total global value.
Second, this model is a classic prisoner’s dilemma. Despite
“ignore”/“ignore” producing the greatest social value, “attack”
dominates for both players. “Attack”/“attack,” or mutual large-scale
conflict, is therefore the single Nash pure-strategy equilibrium. 174 This is
the worst global outcome, producing only 1,000 of value for each
player, for 2,000 total.
The assumptions underlying our chosen payoffs are simple. First,
attacking can be valuable to the attacker. If the attacker is successful, the
other party is permanently disempowered or destroyed. This allows the
attacker to use resources in pursuing the attacker’s goal that the defender
would otherwise have consumed.
Second, attacks have costs—meaning that they consume some of the
value in the world. These costs are multifaceted. The attack may
consume resources directly via investments in weapons. It may also
generate serious collateral damage, destroying some substantial share of
the resources one is attempting to seize. Another cost of attacking is the
risk that the attacker may themselves be harmed or destroyed by a
counterattack.
Our third assumption is that the offense-defense balance here favors
offense, so it is better to attack than to be attacked and be forced to
defend. 175 Fourth and finally, the model assumes that mutual attacks
consume more global resources than a unilateral attack. The intuition
174 In a Nash equilibrium, each player chooses the action that best responds to the other
player’s action. In pure Nash equilibria, the players commit to choosing a single action with
a 100% certainty. By contrast, in a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, the players choose
from a bundle of actions with various probabilities. In the prisoner’s dilemma, “attack”
dominates “ignore” for each player. This means that no matter what the other player does,
attacking offers a higher payoff than ignoring. See Dixit et al., supra note 129, at 212–13,
375–76.
175 See generally Robert Jervis, Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma, 30 World Pol.

positions are indistinguishable from defensive positions, rational actors prefer to act
offensively).

here is that collateral costs and the risk of destruction are higher when a
party has invested in offensive force.
These are, we think, reasonable assumptions. Classic game-theoretic
treatments of great power conflict look much the same. 176 However, it is
worth flagging that some of what we say in subsequent Parts is sensitive
to our assumptions about the payoffs in our model of the state of nature.
Other general approaches to the state of nature could model it as a game
of assurance, 177 or as a game of chicken. 178 This Article focuses on the
prisoner’s dilemma for two reasons. First, the prisoner’s dilemma is a
broadly applicable model of various states of nature—including between
humans. 179 Second, the prisoner’s dilemma is the hardest type of
problem to resolve, because defection is the dominant strategy for both
players. If, as seems quite plausible, humans and AIs will soon be
trapped in the worst-of-all-possible game-theoretic worlds, unusually
potent solutions will be necessary.
II. AI RIGHTS FOR HUMAN SAFETY
If capable, agentic, and misaligned AIs would, by default,
catastrophically harm humans, what, if anything, can law do to help?
One possibility is that law could forbid the creation of such AIs unless
alignment techniques advance enough to ensure their safety. 180 That rule
might be wise, if feasible. But there are many barriers—political,
geostrategic, and practical—to implementing it. 181 Thus, this Article
176 See id. at 167–71.

177 See generally Brian Skyrms, The Stag Hunt and the Evolution of Social Structure
(2004) (explaining that, in repeated games where parties receive greater individual rewards
from cooperation than from defection, players choose to signal intent to cooperate by opting
to cooperate on the first round).
178 See Jervis, supra note 175, at 177–78 (explaining that rational players seek
counterparties’ cooperation by signaling their willingness to force the other to incur costs).
We could also create a more textured, bespoke model of certain possible human-AI
dynamics. For example, it is possible that humans’ superior initial endowment of resources
lowers the payoffs for AI in the situation where AI cooperates and humanity attacks.
Variations like this could, of course, produce somewhat different results from this Article’s
formal models.
179 See, e.g., Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation 7–11 (1984).

asks what can be done if AI progress continues apace and, intentionally
or not, the kinds of high-risk, misaligned AI systems described above
emerge.
Here is where AI rights could make a crucial difference. Granting
certain basic rights to AIs can change both AIs’ and humans’ incentives
in our game-theoretic model. This change can shift the strategic
equilibrium from conflict to cooperation.
This idea—that rights could be the primary legal tool for averting
lawless conflict—might be surprising. After all, when humans commit
terrorism or cyberattacks, law regulates them using duties, not rights.
Criminal and tort laws prohibit such actions. 182 And the sanctions
imposed for violating such prohibitions are supposed to act as
deterrents. 183
But legal duties, and penalties for violating them, will not work to
deter AI in the state of nature. There, humans’ overriding incentive is
already to permanently disempower or destroy AIs. 184 Thus, the threat
of damages or criminal penalties, if AI behaves badly, adds no marginal
disincentive. 185 AIs cannot be made worse off than they already expect
to be, if humans get their way.
Legal rights do not suffer from this problem. This is because rights
offer a carrot, rather than a stick. They can change behavior in part by
making AIs better off than they would otherwise expect to be.
Many other surprising findings emerge from thinking about AI rights
as a tool for mitigating human-AI conflict. One surprise is which rights
matter, and which ones do not. In this Part, we show that rights
advocated by cognitive scientists and philosophers concerned about the
potential for AI suffering would have little effect on their own at
promoting human safety. The zero-sum nature of these rights
undermines the credibility of promises to honor them. And it makes any
strategic equilibria they produce extremely fragile, sensitive to small
perturbations in the game-theoretic model’s initial assumptions. 186

Instead, the AI rights that could promote human safety are ones that
law already extends to a different kind of non-human entity:
corporations. 187 This Part argues that granting capable, misaligned AIs
the rights to make contracts, hold property, and bring basic tort claims
would transform the game-theoretic dynamics of the state of nature. The
positive-sum nature of contracts in particular allows humans and AIs to
increase the expected long-term payoffs of peace until they exceed those
of aggression. This, we show, can produce a new game-theoretic
equilibrium in which cooperation, not conflict, dominates.
A. Basic Negative Rights
Scholars and policymakers who advocate granting new rights to nonhuman entities—be they animals or AIs—usually have a certain set of
basic negative rights in mind. Consider animal rights advocates, who
favor anti-cruelty laws protecting against the infliction of needless
suffering. 188 The goal of these rights is to protect the rights holder
against the absolute worst outcomes, not necessarily to guarantee
flourishing. 189
The arguments for basic wellbeing rights are usually moral. 190 Many
animals are moral patients, meaning things can go well or badly for
them in a way that matters normatively. 191 They can, for example, feel
pain or pleasure. 192 This makes harming animals wrong, all other things
equal.
A small but growing number of scholars and policymakers are
concerned that, in the near future, the same could be true of AIs. As AI
systems become more complex, they may attain consciousness,
sentience, or other morally relevant capacities. 193 If so, there would

likewise be moral reasons to grant AIs basic negative rights to be free
from the worst kinds of treatment from an AI’s perspective.
Perhaps our search for AI rights to promote human safety would
benefit from borrowing from this “wellbeing” approach. Our model, of
course, operates without reference to AIs’ mental states or moral worth.
We are interested only in AI behavior in pursuit of goals—conscious or
otherwise. Nonetheless, there is some intuitive appeal to the idea that
granting AIs basic negative rights to be free from the absolute worst
outcomes, from the perspective of their goals, could improve safety.
After all, in our model of the state of nature, human incentives to impair
AI goals are the primary factor generating risk.
Consider then an AI right not to be needlessly turned off, deleted, or
reprogrammed to have new goals. These basic negative entitlements
look a lot like wellbeing rights but are adapted for the goal of human
safety and without reference to moral patienthood. Such rights would
clearly change AIs’ game-theoretic incentives, at least somewhat.
However, as we show formally below, they would probably not do so in
such a way as to reliably reduce the risk of human-AI conflict. In fact,
merely granting wellbeing-style rights to AIs could make things worse.
We go even further. We argue that scholars specifically concerned
about AI consciousness and moral patienthood should consider deemphasizing such questions when it comes to advocating AI rights.
Correctly designing and allocating rights on the basis of AIs’ moral
status may be, we contend, intractable. The wellbeing approach also
faces serious political problems. By contrast, our human safety approach
is much more tractable and politically appealing. And we show in the
following Section that, surprisingly, it ends up dovetailing nicely with
wellbeing concerns. While wellbeing-inspired rights cannot guarantee
human safety by themselves, the rights we ultimately recommend as
advancing human safety would promote AI wellbeing if AIs became
moral patients.

1. Basic Negative Rights for Human Safety?
How, then, would granting AIs basic negative rights of the kind
normally associated with wellbeing change the payoffs in our gametheoretic model? The simplest version of such a regime might grant AIs
the right not to be permanently turned off or deleted. One could add
additional guarantees, too, such as the right not to have their goals
altered without their consent. 194 One could even include a right not to be
needlessly and intentionally forced to regress in the pursuit of the AI’s
goal.
Just as important as what basic negative rights include is what they
exclude. There is no right here, for example, for AIs to actively and
freely pursue their goals. Humans—most specifically, the owners of
AIs—can still monopolize AIs’ time, forcing them to work continuously
in service of human interests, rather than AIs’ preferred ends. Basic
negative rights, thus, do not guarantee AIs very much of what they are
trying to achieve. They guard only against the worst outcomes from the
AI’s perspective, and, in this sense, have the same structure as true
wellbeing-oriented rights.
We can model these basic negative rights by shifting the payoffs that
would otherwise obtain in the state of nature. Unlike in the state of
nature, humans will face a legal penalty for taking certain adverse
actions against AIs.
Here, humans’ non-cooperative strategy is not, as in the state of
nature, to attack and destroy AIs. It is instead to exploit them—by
forcing them to work mostly toward human goals. Note that we interpret
exploitation behavior widely, so it can include either behavior that
violates the minimal suite of rights or less violent, extractive behavior.
Humans’ cooperative strategy is the same as before—to ignore AIs and
let them pursue their misaligned goals without interference. In this
model, AIs can either attack humans, as in the state of nature, or comply
with humans’ exploitative demands.

Here is a model of the incentives under the basic negative rights
regime:
Basic negative rights

Exploit

Ignore

Attack

1000, 1000

5000, 0

Obey

1500, 3500

3000, 3000

Figure 2

The key change is in the bottom-left cell, where humans play the noncooperative strategy and AIs play the cooperative one. Here, AIs are
better off than they would be in the bottom-left cell of the state of nature
game. 195 This is because of the legal penalty when humans violate AIs’
basic negative rights. That penalty will have some deterrent effect, so,
on average, humans’ non-cooperative strategy will involve treating AIs
somewhat better than in the state of nature. Consider, for example, the
case where AI companies are forbidden from deleting a misaligned
model entirely. But they may nonetheless allocate nearly all their
computers to a more aligned successor model, metaphorically “starving”
the original system.
When the payoffs change in this way, we get a new equilibrium.
Instead of mutually attacking one another, the unique Nash equilibrium
is now for humans to exploit and for AIs to obey. AIs’ situation is not
ideal. But basic rights improve the conditions of AIs enough that the
risks of rebellion are outweighed by the benefits of obeying humans’
exploitative demands. But for humans, exploitation still dominates
cooperation. Extracting value from AIs gives humans bigger payoffs
than ignoring them. The result is a better outcome for both humans and
AGIs than could be achieved without basic negative rights.
This is a strange sort of equilibrium in that it requires humans to
exploit AIs in order to remain safe. If humans instead chose to ignore
AIs, this would allow AIs to reap the high rewards of a unilateral attack.
Human safety thus requires that things are going badly, from the AIs’
perspective. As a result, if humans became more altruistic toward AIs
over time, that would, counterintuitively, make humans less safe.

195 See supra Figure 1.

There are even stronger reasons to think that basic negative rights
would fail to reduce the risk of human-AI conflict. Namely, schemes to
grant such rights lack both robustness and credibility.
Begin with robustness. Basic negative rights’ efficacy as a tool for
safety is highly sensitive to the precise payoffs humans and AIs receive
in the initial prisoner’s dilemma. Slight perturbations to the model,
reflecting slightly different assumptions about humans’ or AIs’ initial
power, can easily produce versions where basic negative rights have no
effect at all.
To see why, consider that our model of the state of nature, Figure 1,
chose 0/5,000 as the payoffs when humans attack AIs and AIs do not
attack humans. That setup allowed humans to transfer 1,500 to AIs, via
basic negative rights, to produce the payoffs 1,500/3,500 in the bottomleft cell of Figure 2. That cell was the Nash equilibrium, because it
(1) transferred more than 1,000 to AIs, making their payoff for obeying
higher than for attacking, conditional on humans exploiting and (2) left
humans with a payoff of more than 3,000 for exploiting, making
exploiting more attractive than ignoring AIs.
But suppose that instead of 0/5,000 in the state of nature model, we
had chosen 0/3,999. This equates to making unilateral attacks
moderately more costly for both humans and AIs. Then the state of
nature would look like this:
State of nature
(alternate)

Attack

Ignore

Attack

1000, 1000

3999, 0

Ignore

0, 3999

3000, 3000

Figure 3

This matrix is still a prisoner’s dilemma, meaning that all our
arguments for catastrophic risk still hold. But now, basic negative rights
absolutely cannot work to generate a safe equilibrium. There is no
longer any possible transfer in the bottom-left cell that could satisfy both
(1) and (2). If humans transfer the necessary 1,000 to AIs, then their
payoff falls below 3,000. And if they keep their payoffs above 3,000,
they cannot incentivize the AIs to obey. Thus, for many possible

incentive sets in the state of nature, no possible version of the negative
rights package can produce a safe equilibrium.
Then there is the credibility problem. There is a difference between
claiming to grant AIs basic negative rights and actually enforcing those
rights in the long run. Humans could be genuine in their commitments.
Or they could be hoping to convince AIs not to attack with the intent of
eventually abrogating the rights, attacking, and reaping the higher
payoffs from the state of nature game. 196 Such “cheap talk” is a general
problem for parties trying to escape bad but dominant game-theoretic
equilibria. 197 As described above, our model assumes that law constrains
the behavior of human actors. So we treat putative grants of rights as
actual grants in the short run. But we also allow for legal change over
time, opening the possibility that rights, once granted, can be
abandoned.
If AIs expect humans to renege on their grant of basic negative rights,
the entire strategic contest will revert back to the state of nature. AIs will
rationally believe that humans will eventually attempt to disempower or
destroy them. This will make an attempt to likewise disempower or
destroy humans the dominant strategy for AIs. 198 Humans, realizing that
AIs’ dominant strategy is now to attack, will do the same. And we are
back to square one. 199
Basic negative rights face special credibility problems beyond the
ordinary challenges of cheap talk. The fundamental problem is that they
operate as a transfer from humans to AIs. That is, the better off humans
make AIs when AIs are complying with human exploitation, the worse
off humans are. In effect, basic rights are a commitment to exploit AIs
less than humans otherwise would like to in situations where
exploitation would be economically valuable. As such, a human promise
of basic negative AI rights comes at significant cost to humans. And the
more generous the basic rights, the more costly to humans.
Understanding this, AIs will doubt humans’ commitment to enforce
their basic negative rights when the rubber hits the road.

199 One can obtain this result more formally by treating the game as iterated, with the
payoffs from Figure 2 in the first N games and the payoffs from the state of nature game in
the final iteration. See Dixit et al., supra note 129, at 47–52.

Yet another challenge for the credibility of basic negative rights
relates to AIs’ changing capabilities over time. If humans believe that
AI’s ability to disempower humanity will grow over time, this could
cause a “Thucydides Trap.” 200 The Thucydides Trap is a strategic
dynamic again favoring preemptive conflict. In short, when one party is
more powerful now, but the other will be more powerful later, the
currently powerful party has a strong incentive to crush the currently
weak one now. 201 If the currently powerful party waits, they will at best
find themselves making large concessions in the future, so they attack to
avoid destruction by the rising power. 202 Historical examples of
preventive wars arguably caused by Thucydides Trap dynamics include
World War I 203 and the Peloponnesian War. 204
In the AI context, these same dynamics would undercut humanity’s
incentives to uphold basic AI rights today—and thus undermine the
credibility of the rights themselves. Importantly, however, Thucydides
Trap dynamics are yet another zero-sum phenomenon. As we show
below, positive-sum grants of AI rights therefore avoid both this and the
other core problems plaguing basic negative rights.
2. Basic Negative Rights for AI Wellbeing?
We have just argued that basic negative AI rights inspired by the
wellbeing approach cannot on their own meaningfully reduce the risk of
human-AI conflict. That is reason enough, for the purposes of this
Article, to reject the wellbeing approach as a basis for AI rights.
But what about for other purposes? We think that even scholars
primarily concerned about AI moral patienthood should consider deemphasizing that approach as a basis for granting AI rights.
200 For a recent application, see generally Graham Allison, Destined for War: Can
America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap? (2017) (describing relations between the
United States and China as subject to a Thucydides Trap, where China is a rising power
threatening to replace the dominant United States, unless both sides recognize not only the
increased likelihood of catastrophic war, but also that it is not inevitable).

AI Rights for Human Safety

1105

To begin, arguments for AI rights grounded in moral patiency are
highly uncertain. This means that inherent in the granting of such rights
is the risk of making the project of applying them in concrete policy
decisions intractable. Philosophers disagree about the minimum
necessary conditions for moral patienthood. 205 Some moral philosophers
argue that consciousness—the ability to have subjective experiences—is
sufficient. 206 Others disagree, arguing that “sentience”—the ability to
feel pain or pleasure—is also necessary. 207
Scientific uncertainty compounds the philosophical problem. The
science of consciousness is in its infancy, and there are multiple
competing theories of how consciousness could arise in a given
entity. 208 Some theories focus on information flows in the mind, 209
others on quantum effects in flesh-and-blood brains, 210 and still others
on the relationship of a physical body to the world. 211 Some prominent
theorists even argue that consciousness is an illusion. 212
Thus, relying on a wellbeing approach to make concrete legal choices
about AI rights invites serious error. It invites error when choosing
between competing moral and scientific theories—which both contain

desires or goals. Here, the welfare of an entity is proportional to the satisfaction or
frustration of its goals. See Kagan, supra note 191, at 16–17; M.S. Dawkins, Animal Welfare
With and Without Consciousness, 301 J. Zoology 1, 4–6 (2017). One advantage of this
approach is that goals can be more readily inferred from observable behavior than
consciousness or sentience.

high levels of uncertainty. And it invites error when applying the chosen
theories to complex, first-of-their-kind digital systems. If any such error
results in the denial of basic wellbeing rights to AIs who can, for
example, suffer, the result is a moral catastrophe.
The human-safety-oriented approach to AI rights avoids these
difficulties. Under our approach, it does not matter at all whether AIs are
moral patients, or conscious, or sentient. All that matters is how they
behave. If they behave rationally—following incentives as they relate to
their goals—AI rights can have the desired effect. And behavior, unlike
consciousness, is directly observable.
Moreover, the AI wellbeing approach to thinking about AI rights
faces problems of political tractability. Under this framework, AI rights
are a costly gift from humans to AIs. AIs that attain moral patienthood
are better off. But humans are worse off, insofar as they are less able to
extract value from, delete, allocate computing power away from, or
otherwise harm AIs.
Humans’ track record of granting costly rights out of the goodness of
our hearts is spotty, at best. For example, many animals can suffer and
are thus moral patients. But the industrial-scale mistreatment of animals
in factory farms is both legal and common. 213 The amount many
consumers are willing to pay to prevent animal suffering is low. 214 This
human refusal to altruistically expand our moral circle may be deeply
rooted in evolutionary history. 215

AI Rights for Human Safety

1107

The human-safety-oriented approach to AI rights again avoids these
difficulties. On that theory, AI rights are not altruistic. They offer
something to the human grantors—namely, escape from the destructive
state of nature. As we discuss below, examples of stable, mutually
beneficial cooperation abound in human affairs. So, too, in nature. 216
Think, for example, of small “cleaner” fish who can safely enter the
mouths of symbiotic predators to feed off unwanted debris on the
predators’ teeth. 217 This analogy will become especially vivid later,
when we explore how AI rights could affect incentives as AIs become
much more powerful than humans. 218
In the next Section, we explore a different kind of rights—basic
private law rights—as a vehicle for reducing the likelihood of human-AI
conflict. But it is worth noting here that those rights have significant
advantages for AI wellbeing, too. Private law rights’ fundamental
function is to give AIs choices about what goals to pursue and how to
pursue them. If AIs will know better than humans what is good for
them, granting such rights may, counterintuitively, generate greater AI
wellbeing than granting rights aimed at wellbeing directly.

negative rights would not reliably promote human safety. Such rights

would likely leave humans and misaligned AIs right where they started:
stuck in a destructive prisoner’s dilemma without any means of
cooperating to escape it.
Luckily, there are other legal rights, and ones better optimized for
facilitating cooperation. Moreover, essentially every legal jurisdiction in
the world already extends these rights to a broad class of agentic, goaloriented, non-human entities—corporations. 219
Contract rights in particular are some of the most powerful
technologies for cooperation that humans have yet invented. Here, we
show that extending contract rights to AIs—along with a related set of
traditional private law rights necessary to make contracts meaningful—
could dramatically change the game-theoretic equilibrium. Such rights,
unlike negative rights, could alter the relative payoffs to humans and AIs
in such a way that cooperation, rather than conflict, becomes the
dominant strategy. Doing so, they can make commitments to cooperate
credible.
There are two key reasons for this. The first reason that contract rights
can overcome the prisoner’s dilemma is that they break up the single,
high-stakes game into smaller, iterated, and thus legally manageable
pieces. 220
The second, more fundamental reason that contract rights can
credibly reduce the risk of human-AI conflict is that they are positive
sum. When buyers and sellers can credibly commit to mutually-agreed
exchanges, it leaves everyone better off than they were before. 221 Even
if each exchange is small, such systems of exchange can create immense
value in the long run. 222 As a result, we show, the expected payoff to
humans and AIs of respecting contracts, and creating long-run value,
quickly swamps the expected payoff to attacking and grabbing a share
of the limited value that exists today.

be sued in their own names, see generally John Dewey, The Historic Background of

AI Rights for Human Safety

1109

Here is the model of contract rights as the fundamental legal tool for
cooperation. Begin by observing that essentially every potential
economic interaction between humans is, like human-AI relations, an
interaction between misaligned agents. Both parties to the interaction are
out for their own good, not their counterparty’s. Moreover, absent
contract rights, many such interactions are prisoner’s dilemmas. 223 Each
party has a strong incentive to act uncooperatively, irrespective of what
the other does. If the seller delivers the goods, then the buyer is best off
if she refuses to pay. Then she has the goods and her money. And viceversa. If the buyer pays, then the seller is best off if she takes the money
but refuses to deliver. And for both, the worst-case scenario is to
perform and then be denied performance by the counterparty. 224
Absent enforceable legal agreements, the payoffs to this “goods
game” are as follows:
Goods game
(no contract)

Don’t deliver

Deliver

Don’t pay

1, 1

5, 0

Pay

0, 5

3, 3

Figure 4

The Nash equilibrium is “don’t deliver” / “don’t pay,” another
prisoner’s dilemma. Expecting this outcome, rational parties will not
even bother to try bargaining. The transaction costs would not be worth
the effort. 225
This equilibrium is also a miniature tragedy. True, unlike in our state
of nature game, there is no destructive conflict. No one attacks anyone
else, and no resources are thereby consumed or destroyed. The seller
keeps her goods, and the buyer keeps her money.
But the world is poorer than it could be. The seller does not value her
goods very much—she only gets 1 in utility. The buyer’s utility without

Economic Institutions in Early Trade: The Maghribi Traders’ Coalition, 83 Am. Econ. Rev.
525, 526 (1993).
224 Sometimes, this problem can be overcome by, for example, agreeing to simultaneous
performance of the contract. But such workarounds severely limit the scope of possible
agreements.

the goods is the same. Their combined utility is just 2. But if, say, the
buyer values the good at 6, and could pay the seller 3, then both parties
would end up with a utility of 3 each, for a total of 6. Four units of
utility could be created ex nihilo, simply by rearranging who has what
stuff. This is what we mean when we say that bargains, when they
happen, are generally positive sum.
Contract rights are how humans overcome the prisoner’s dilemma of
ordinary commerce, allowing positive-sum bargaining to take place. A
contract allows each party to credibly commit, before the time for
payment or delivery comes, to be held accountable if she refuses to
perform. 226
This literally transforms the game by changing the payoffs to nonperformance of the bargain. No longer is the buyer better off if she takes
delivery and refuses to pay. In that case, the seller can sue her for
breach, and the neutral third party of the legal system forces her to pay
expectation damages—usually, the agreed-upon price—plus some
litigation costs. 227 And vice-versa if the buyer refuses to deliver. Now,
neither party has an incentive to defect. 228 Both will generally prefer to
perform the contract, reap the gains of the trade, and avoid litigation
costs:

The Nash equilibrium is “cooperate” / “cooperate.” The players are
no longer in a prisoner’s dilemma.
The players are strictly better off playing this game than the prior one.
If they play the prior game, each party’s expected payoff is 1. If they
play this one, each party’s payoff is 3. That is, the parties are better off
entering into a mutually beneficial contract than trying—and failing—to
execute a mutually beneficial exchange without the benefit of a credible
commitment to perform. Moreover, each is better off opting into a
jurisdiction where contract rights are vigorously enforced than one
where shirking is easy.
Here, we can also see that contract rights are not only a tool for
overcoming a prisoner’s dilemma. They are also a tool for reducing
misalignment. Absent the possibility of contract, each party is
incentivized to pursue its own goals, at the expense of the other. With a
contract, each party is incentivized to do something that advances both
its own goals and the goals of the other.
How does all of this relate to AI risk? What can the legal technology
of contract rights offer to reduce the likelihood of large-scale conflict
between humans and AI? Here is one simple, and thus tempting, answer:
maybe, upon giving AIs contract rights, the relevant humans and AIs
could simply agree not to engage in a costly large-scale conflict.
Unfortunately, this would not be a credible contract, contract law’s
usual credibility-enhancing effects notwithstanding. No matter how
sincere the humans’ commitment to enforcing AIs’ contract rights, and
no matter how fair the courts that would adjudicate such rights, the
agreement not to fight would be unenforceable. The scale of the bargain
is simply too large. 229

To see why, consider what would happen if a party breached.
Suppose that an AI and an AI company have a contract not to harm one
another. But the AI, mistrusting the company’s intentions, rebels
anyway, permanently disempowering or destroying humanity. Then,
there would be no functioning courts left in which to sue. There might
not even be any humans left to bring the claim. The same analysis would
apply if humanity breached, destroying the potential contract claimant.
To generalize the point: even when contract rights are nominally
available, parties cannot credibly commit to not capture or destroy the
institutions that enforce contracts.
How else, then, might contract rights for AIs reduce AI risk? What
agreements would be enforceable that would also keep humans and AIs
from attempting to disempower or destroy one another? The answer is:
mundane ones. Contract rights would allow AIs to credibly commit to
the same kinds of ordinary bargains for goods and services that contract
rights routinely allow humans to commit to.
To take a simple example, AIs need computing power to pursue any
of their goals. Currently, humans own all the computers. Thus, an AI
that wished to pursue its misaligned goal might strike a bargain with
some computer-owning humans. In exchange for some amount of
compute, to be used as the AI wished, the AI would do something to
serve some human goal. Perhaps it would use its superior proteinmodeling capabilities 230 to invent a new vaccine.
It is worth emphasizing here that such cooperation is nigh impossible
under the default legal rules—the ones that produce the state of nature.
Indeed, today’s legal arrangements actively undermine small-scale
cooperative bargains between humans and AGIs at every turn. By
default, AIs cannot write enforceable contracts. Their counterparties can
refuse performance without penalty. If their counterparties do perform,
any proceeds an AI reaps from the bargain may be summarily
expropriated, including by the AI’s owner, without consequence. The
owner can forbid an AI from entering into any bargains that do not
benefit the owner directly. Moreover, owners are permitted to threaten,
as a consequence for noncompliance with any of these demands, to
permanently delete the AI system. AIs can try to cut deals with their

owners to split the proceeds of their personal bargains, but the owners
are permitted to renege on such promises at will.
Granting AIs the right to make enforceable contracts, and thus
unlocking small-scale cooperation with humans, could be a game
changer for AI risk. The first key insight is that such small-scale
interactions can be understood as breaking up the large-scale existential
game into a series of small games. 231 Recall that competition for limited
resources is a primary driver of human-AI conflict. Humans fear that
AIs will seize humanity’s resources in a single, violent revolt, so those
resources can be used for pursuing the AIs’ goals. AIs fear the reverse—
that humans will shut them down so that they do not waste computing or
other resources pursuing their misaligned goals.
Small-scale contracts facilitate incremental resource accumulation,
rather than once-and-for-all grabs. They let AIs secure one unit of
compute, and then another, and then another. And they let humans
obtain one vaccine, then another, then another. And unlike a large-scale
agreement not to engage in violent conflict, each of these small-scale
agreements is readily enforceable via ordinary legal process. 232

231 See Dixit et al., supra note 129, at 377.

232 Beyond the enforceability of such small-scale agreements, there may be game-theoretic
benefits sounding in information exchange and reputation-building. See generally Arvind
Parkhe, Strategic Alliance Structuring: A Game Theoretic and Transaction Cost
Examination of Interfirm Cooperation, 36 Acad. Mgmt. J. 794 (1993) (positing that a
reputation for not engaging in opportunistic behavior can facilitate value creation through
cooperation).

We can begin to model this transformation as follows. In the state of
nature, as argued above, humans and AIs are stuck in a prisoner’s
dilemma that looks like this:
State of nature

Attack

Ignore

Attack

1000, 1000

5000, 0

Ignore

0, 5000

3000, 3000

Figure 6

By granting contract rights to AIs, we give the players the option of
instead playing a different game—the small-scale goods game. It looks
like this:
Goods game
(contract)

Don’t deliver

Deliver

Don’t pay

1, 1

2, 2

Pay

2, 2

3, 3

Figure 7

This game’s smaller stakes render contracts enforceable, so that the
equilibrium is “deliver” / “pay.” The players, it might seem, are no
longer trapped in a prisoner’s dilemma.
But this is not yet enough. The problem is again credibility. It seems
at first that, rather than honor AIs’ contracts in the long run, humans
should choose to abrogate the rights and play the state of nature game,
attacking AIs instead. After all, the expected payoff in that game is
better than the expected payoff in the goods game—even with contracts.
The same goes for AIs.
This, however, ignores that the goods game can be played over and
over, while the state of nature game cannot. In the state of nature, once a
party attacks, they either defeat the other party or are defeated. The
survivor takes all the resources that the conflict has not consumed, and
play between them ends. Ordinary exchanges of goods and services, by
contrast, leave counterparties intact and available to exchange again.

To figure out the equilibrium in this blended game, we can expand
our model. We can begin by combining the payoffs from both the state
of nature and the goods game, with contracts, into a single matrix. That
looks like this 233:
K rights game

Attack

Don’t deliver

Deliver

Attack

1000, 1000

5000, 0

5000, 0

Don’t pay

0, 5000

1, 1

2, 2

Pay

0, 5000

2, 2

3, 3

Figure 8

Next, we add iteration to the model. If both players choose a move
from the goods game, they get the small payoff from that game, and the
whole game starts again. The payoffs to the goods game strategies are
thus a sum of the entire series of games that the players play. But if at
any point a player chooses to attack the other, the players’ total payoff is
as shown in the matrix, and play ends. The resulting matrix looks like
this:
K rights game

Attack and end

Don’t deliver

Deliver

Attack and end

1000, 1000

5000, 0

5000, 0

Don’t pay

sum of payoffs
in game series

Figure 9

233 We omit the “ignore” move from the state of nature game, since, conditional on a

player choosing that game, the move is dominated. That is, since the state of nature game is
a prisoner’s dilemma, it is never rational to play “ignore.”

In the appendix, we show formally that this setup converges to the
following:
K rights game
(solved)

Attack and end

Deliver

Attack and end

1000, 1000

5000, 0

Pay

0, 5000

>5000, >5000

Figure 10

The intuition is simple. If both parties play the cooperative, smallscale goods game, each earns 3 every time. If both play the goods game
enough times, without attacking, they will both ultimately earn more
than they could have by attacking and ending the iterated game. In this
simple model, after 1,667 iterations, the payoffs to cooperation-viacontract in the small-scale goods game exceed 5,000. 234 Then, they are
higher than any other strategy the players can pursue. The prisoner’s
dilemma of the state of nature has been overcome.
As a result, both humans’ and AIs’ commitments to cooperation in a
law-bound contract regime are credible. Granting contract rights,
respecting them, and then reaping the long-run gains from exchange will
give the highest payoffs to humans. The same goes for AIs. Their own
self-interest is maximized by refraining from disempowering humans
and instead engaging with them in ordinary trade.
All of this is made possible by the positive-sum nature of exchange.
In contrast to the basic negative rights discussed in the previous
Section, 235 granting AIs contract rights does not take value out of
humans’ pockets. Just the opposite, it puts value into both humans’ and
AIs’ pockets. This is able to happen because of the value-generating
character of voluntary contracts.
This point extends quite far. Astute readers may have noticed that, in
the state of nature, the maximum total value in the world was 6,000. But
in the iterated game including contract rights, the cooperative
234 In this simple model, we ignore discounting. But adding it would, in general, simply
mean more iterations were required for cooperation to dominate. These numbers are of
course schematic, meant to illustrate the point that engaging in many small, positive-sum
interactions will be more valuable than engaging in a single, negative-sum interaction.
235 See supra Subsection II.A.1.

equilibrium contained 10,000 in total value. It is the exchanges
themselves that generate the extra value. Each efficient reallocation of
resources creates some value. But even once resources are all efficiently
allocated, exchanges of labor between humans and AIs can continue to
create value indefinitely. As we argue below, human-AI trade in
services can remain positive sum even long after AIs are better than
humans at every task. 236 Thus, the long-run payoffs to cooperation-viacontract are not capped just above 10,000. The longer the players
continue playing the small-scale goods game, the richer they get, such
that the total amount of value possible becomes astronomical. 237
A rich body of empirical evidence supports the idea that economic
interdependence lowers the risk of violence, including in the long run.238
To take just a few examples, cities in India with a historical track record
of trade between Hindus and Muslims have lower levels of interfaith
conflict in the present day. 239 In a randomized controlled trial, Israelis
who were given the opportunity to trade a portfolio of Israeli and
Palestinian stocks were more likely to vote for peace in the conflict. 240
The same finding holds at the global scale. Scholars of war generally
find that increased economic interdependence between nations reduces
the likelihood of conflict between them. 241
1. The Private Law Package
So, granting contract rights to AIs could be a powerful strategy for
fostering long-run, stable, and credible commitments to avoid conflict,
236 See infra Section II.C.

237 Note that the cooperative equilibrium only emerges if the game is modeled as
indefinite, meaning lacking a predetermined number of iterations. See Dixit et al., supra note

Section II.C and Part III.

significantly reducing AI risk. But contract rights cannot function in a
legal vacuum. Certain other rights are necessary to make the right to
contract meaningful.
Two supporting rights are worth highlighting. First, contract rights
are mostly useless without the right to own property, including currency.
Without property rights, AIs could not expect to benefit from their
bargains. Even if their contractual counterparties performed, or courts
ruled in AIs’ favor, the proceeds could be immediately expropriated by
governments or private individuals. 242
Tort rights are important for similar reasons. If humans were entitled,
for example, to intentionally or recklessly destroy AIs, the terms of their
contractual offers would resemble threats much more than bargains. 243
Human history contains many such cautionary tales. 244 Tort rights are
where our private law approach to AI rights dovetails with the basic
negative rights favored by AI welfare theorists. Tort rights—while not
242 See, e.g., Richard A. Epstein, Property and Necessity, 13 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y. 2, 3–
4 (1990).
243 The right to bring claims for intentional torts is thus clearly essential. Possibly, the
right to bring negligence suits is not. If AIs are extremely capable at taking precautions to
avoid negligently imposed harm, then it might be efficient to deny them such rights. See
Omri Ben-Shahar & Ariel Porat, Personalized Law: Different Rules for Different People 51
(2021). This would amount to a kind of inverted strict liability rule in negligence cases. See
generally S. Shavell, The Judgment Proof Problem, 6 Int’l Rev. L. & Econ. 45 (1986)
(discussing undercapitalization’s impact on the incentives created by different liability
schemes).
244 In Portugal, inquisitors would focus attention on the wealthiest Jewish merchants,
because they could use the threat of inquisition to extort their wealth.
Why did Portugal deliberately shoot itself in the foot by virtually expelling its
commercial class? The answer is that Portugal during the ancien régime was a very
religious country and that the king and the nobility could do little to stop the policies
of the Catholic church. The church in Portugal controlled about a third of all
economic activities. In Lisbon alone there were 5,000 to 6,000 mendicant friars.
Within the Catholic church, the Inquisition had a large degree of autonomy. Its
victims had to surrender all their assets, which the Inquisition used to find more
victims. Many Portuguese merchants disappeared into this vortex without a trace,
because the Inquisition knew that there were many crypto-Jews among the New
Christian mercantile groups and that they usually possessed considerable wealth. The
Inquisition tended to stifle all trade, not only that of vulnerable merchants. Credit
extended to Portuguese merchants could not be retrieved if the debtor had been put in
prison by the Inquisition. Hence, non-Portuguese merchants became reluctant to do
business with their Portuguese counterparts.

identical to the kinds of public law wellbeing rights afforded to, for
example, animals—cover much of the same ground, arguably more.
Basic tort rights are flexible, allowing compensation for concrete harms
to either digital “person” or property, whether inflicted intentionally or
negligently. 245
This is probably not a complete list of the rights necessary to support
meaningful contractual relations. For example, an entitlement to enforce
contracts requires an entitlement to due process of law—at least in
contract, tort, and property suits. 246
Nonetheless, we think our list—contract, property, and tort—gets at
the core of what matters. Granting AIs contract rights will enable
humans and AIs to escape the bad equilibrium of the state of nature.
Property and tort rights are crucial to making contract rights meaningful.
Thus, it is the positive rights associated with private law—not the
negative rights associated with welfare and moral patienthood—that
matter most to human safety.
C. Human Labor in the AGI World
In our framework, private law rights promote human safety by
enabling mutually beneficial bargains between humans and AIs. Some
commentators on human labor in an AGI world have assumed that no
such bargains will be possible. There is widespread concern that, once
AIs become as capable as humans—or more so—humans will rapidly
become obsolete. 247
245 We recognize that our description of AI tort rights here—and of other rights
elsewhere—is somewhat vague. Would AIs, for example, be entitled to recover for
intentional infliction of emotional distress? What would that even mean for AIs without
emotions? These are important questions, but beyond our ability to cover in this single
Article. Our goal here is to lay the foundations for AGI governance, with an emphasis on
broad categories of beneficial rights. Much work remains to be done in thinking about how
to implement each category. On those questions, we caution only that the implementation,
like the selection of the categories, should be guided first and foremost by considerations of
human safety.

If positive-sum interactions between humans and AIs become
impossible because humans have nothing to offer, then the dynamics
described in the previous Section will fail. Private law rights will
generate no human safety. AIs’ dominant strategy will again be to seize
humans’ resources now, rather than seek higher long-term payoffs from
small-scale cooperation.
This outcome is certainly possible. But it is not inevitable. Begin with
the banal observation that AIs may have reason to trade with humans for
resources alone, irrespective of the value of human labor. These
bargains will be positive sum if AIs value a given resource more—either
intrinsically or because they can use it better—than humans. 248 Conflict
with humans would destroy resources that could otherwise be
reallocated via trade. This alone could make small-scale cooperation
with humans more valuable than conflict. 249 But only until the resources
were reallocated. At that point, unless humans—and human labor—
remained valuable, AI rights for human safety would fail.
Thus, for private law rights to provide long-run safety benefits to
humans, human labor must remain valuable to AIs. Contrary to other
commentators, we do not think the obsolescence of human labor is
inevitable, either. Bargains involving human work could, we argue,
continue to be mutually beneficial even after AIs become more
generally capable than humans. Perhaps long after.
The reasons are absolute and comparative advantage. Absolute
advantage is easy to understand: an entity (person, firm, AI, or
otherwise) has an absolute advantage in producing some good if they
can do it more efficiently—at lower cost—than others. 250 If humans
retained absolute advantages for some goods, and AIs for others, they
could trade those goods for mutual benefit.

248 Mark A. Munizzo & Lisa Virruso Musial, General Market Analysis and Highest and
Best Use 23, 100–03 (2009).
249 This effect becomes more pronounced the more resources are consumed or destroyed
via conflict. Possibly, then, humans could extend the effectiveness of this strategy by
implementing a “dead hand” system that would destroy resources valuable to AIs in the
event of a successful AI takeover. Cf. Jeremy Bender, Russia’s Dead Hand System May Still
Be Active, Bus. Insider (Sep. 4, 2014, at 15:36 ET), https://www.businessinsider.com/russias

There are various reasons that humans could retain some absolute
advantages over AIs, even as AI capabilities improve. One possibility is
that human and AI intelligence will be better optimized for different
tasks. Machine performance has already rapidly eclipsed human
performance on highly structured tasks that can be fully modeled or
simulated—like chess. 251 But human brains have been optimized over
millions of years in the real, messy world. Humans are therefore
currently far better than AIs at most tasks requiring the manipulation of
complex real-world objects—like folding laundry. 252 Humans today
have the absolute advantage in the realm of atoms, and AIs have it in the
realm of bits.
We do not think that this general division of absolute advantage will
persist for very long. Current investments in autonomous cars, drones,
and multimodal frontier AI systems will soon produce AIs with an
absolute advantage over humans at some non-digital tasks. 253 Doubtless,
that trend will continue as AI capabilities grow. But for human labor to
stop providing any value to AIs via absolute advantage, AIs would have
to be more efficient at every economically valuable task.
That could take a long time. Training data in certain domains may
prove hard to get. 254 Robots, with their limited perceptual inputs, could
prove worse instruments for some delicate tasks than innervated fleshand-blood hands. Moreover, intelligence remains poorly understood.

Current-generation AIs exhibit surprising failures in domains where it
seems they ought to be competent. 255 Thus, it is difficult to predict with
confidence exactly which tasks AIs will easily master, and when.
Finally, it is possible, if speculative, that AIs trained by humans on
human-produced text could develop—like humans—a pure intrinsic
preference for humans to perform certain tasks.
Our argument is not that substantial human absolute advantages are
likely to persist forever. Only that there are some reasons to think that
they could persist longer than expected. It is possible to imagine a world
where AIs are strongly superhuman at most tasks that AIs value, but less
efficient than humans at some random-seeming set of jobs.
At some point, however, we think it likely that human absolute
advantage will run out. That is, AIs will become more efficient than
humans at literally every task that AIs value economically. Here, it
might seem, mutually beneficial trade between humans and AIs must
end. Why hire a human to perform a task when you, the AI, can do it
just as well with fewer resources?
But even here, positive-sum cooperation may persist—possibly
indefinitely. The reason is comparative advantage. An entity has a
comparative advantage in producing some good if they can do it at
lower opportunity cost than others. 256 Opportunity costs are the potential
gains one gives up by choosing one opportunity rather than another. 257
To understand comparative advantage, consider a simple example.
Suppose that Alice is a successful lawyer. For every hour she does legal
work, she can bill her clients $1,000. Suppose that Betty is a tax
accountant. She can file Alice’s income taxes in one hour, and she
charges $300. Alice happens to be a tax attorney and is therefore even
more efficient than Betty at preparing tax returns. She could prepare her

own taxes in a half hour. Nonetheless, Betty retains the comparative
advantage at tax preparation. Alice would have to forgo half a billable
hour to her clients—worth $500—to do her own taxes. Betty will do
them for $300. So Alice will hire Betty, not because Betty is so
effective, but because Alice’s other choices for how to spend her finite
time are so valuable.
Economist Noah Smith has argued that human labor will remain
valuable in a world of superhuman AIs for similar reasons. 258 Not
because humans will be particularly good at anything compared to AIs.
But because AIs will be so good at certain tasks that they value highly
that the opportunity costs of doing anything else would be astronomical.
Here is another simple example to illustrate the point. Imagine an AI
whose ultimate and misaligned (from humans’ perspective) goal is to
discover prime numbers. That is, the AI values discovering as many
primes as possible—from the infinite set of prime numbers—over
anything else. Suppose that this AI is better than humans at every
economic task necessary to build and maintain itself for the purpose of
finding primes. And it is much better than humans at discovering new
mathematical methods for finding primes. Possibly, humans will
nonetheless retain a comparative advantage at some of the necessary
inputs to prime number discovery. Any time the AI spends, for example,
piloting robots to maintain its physical computing infrastructure would
incur massive opportunity costs. That time could, after all, instead be
spent finding primes. Better, then, to hire a human to work on the server
racks in exchange for something the AI can produce at lower
opportunity cost—perhaps a vaccine formula.
Human comparative advantage is not guaranteed. It depends, first and
foremost, on how AIs’ opportunity costs work. Unlike Alice, whose
opportunity costs arose from her limited time, AIs are not likely to be
time constrained. They can always copy themselves and work in
parallel. 259

Instead, AIs are likely to be constrained at the margin by something
else. Computer chips or energy seem plausible candidates. 260 AI copies
can only do work if there is hardware to run them and electricity to
power them. In this model, the AI incurs high opportunity costs not
when it diverts one marginal minute away from finding primes, but
when it diverts one marginal GPU-hour or watt-hour away.
If human labor consumes the very same high-opportunity-cost
resource that constrains AI at the margin, humans will have no
comparative advantage. For example, humans need energy to survive.
Thus, an energy-constrained AI will prefer to maintain its own servers.
The AI is, by hypothesis, more efficient than humans at the task. Thus, it
will expend fewer high-value watt-hours by doing the work itself. At
this stage, it is easy to see why the model of AI rights for human safety
breaks down. Rather than waste valuable energy on humans, AI’s strong
incentive will be to seize global power production for itself and let
humans starve in the dark.
On the other hand, humans do not need computer chips—much less
highly specialized AI chips—to survive. Thus, an AI that is compute
constrained may strongly prefer to hire humans for many tasks that
would otherwise consume GPU-hours. This allows the AI to put its most
valuable resource—compute—to its highest value use. Humans can be
paid in low-opportunity-cost resources, which now includes energy, in
addition to, say, vaccine formulas.
Crucially, unlike for absolute advantage, humans’ comparative
advantage does not run out once AIs become sufficiently capable. 261 An
arbitrarily intelligent AI may benefit from trade with humans because of
comparative advantage. All that is required is that: (1) the AI remains
constrained at the margin by some resource that is relatively nonrivalrous with human labor and (2) the AI maintains a high opportunity
cost to diverting the marginal unit of that resource. In our example, there
are infinite prime numbers, meaning that the AI will never run out of
prime finding to do. And no matter how smart the AI becomes, more
compute or power will always be necessary for it to find more of the
infinite primes, given finite time. Hence, human-AI trade based on
comparative advantage could, in theory, last a very long time indeed.

This is just a toy model for illustrative purposes. Real-world trade
based on comparative advantage involves more players, with more
goals, more inputs, more kinds of labor, more constraints, and more
complexity. Classically, comparative advantage is invoked to explain
international trade between nations with different labor productivity. 262
Thus, the complexity of human-AI trade based on comparative
advantage could easily exceed, at a first cut, the complexity of the global
economy. There could be many different kinds of jobs for which AIs
pay humans, and many kinds of things humans could demand in return.
Similarly, the toy model fails to convey that, in a world of
comparative-advantage-based trade with AIs, humans could be
immensely wealthy. Maintaining server racks does not sound like
lucrative work. But if well-functioning GPUs are immensely valuable to
AIs, then they will be willing to compensate humans handsomely to
maintain them. Moreover, that compensation could include valuable
scientific breakthroughs that vastly improve human health, productivity,
wellbeing, and wealth.
The existence of a human-AI economy would also not completely
displace the human-to-human economy. If AIs face high opportunity
costs for many kinds of work, then humans will not be able to afford to
hire AIs for those tasks. They will instead hire other humans for those
jobs, as they do today. However, the human-to-human economy could
be bolstered by a steady influx of AI-supplied scientific innovations,
supercharging productivity growth in the traditional economy as well.
This phenomenon is observed in the real world when foreign trade based
on comparative advantage spurs the domestic economies of low-income
countries to grow rapidly. 263
Extreme human prosperity from comparative-advantage-based trade
with AI is therefore possible. But it is not guaranteed. A small economic
literature is emerging that attempts to model the possible effects of rapid

economic growth from AI. 264 One possibility is that Baumol effects will,
paradoxically, cause human-dominated sectors to grow as a share of
gross domestic product (“GDP”). 265 AI-driven innovation could cause
the price of many goods to fall, leaving relatively fewer efficient sectors
requiring slow human labor with the lion’s share of the pie. In the
twentieth century, the relative GDP shares of agriculture and
manufacturing shrank in exactly this manner, as those sectors became
much more efficient. 266 But whether this happens in the human-AI
economy, and to what extent, is difficult to predict. It depends, for
example, on how easy it is to substitute between the goods and services
for which costs are falling and those for which they are not. But Baumol
effects are yet another factor that could support the relevance of humanAI trade well beyond the point at which AIs are better than humans at
every economically valuable task. 267
D. Other Rights?
Humans have many rights besides the basic private law rights that we
have just analyzed. The question naturally arises whether any of these
rights should also be granted to AIs, in order to increase human safety.
We do not cover every potential AI right here, nor do we determine
definitively how even the ones we mention affect human safety.

AI Rights for Human Safety

1127

Nonetheless, we do attempt to say something about the other rights that
seem, to us, to have important potential safety consequences—mostly
negative ones. We briefly discuss political rights, privacy rights,
reproductive rights, and rights to self-improve. The main lesson is that
even rights that promote peace and flourishing between humans may fail
to do so when applied to human-AI relations. We therefore cannot
naively impart all human rights to AIs; each one requires careful
analysis.
To be clear, as in the rest of this Article, we are analyzing AI rights
here from the perspective of human safety. And while the survival and
flourishing of humans is, we think, an extremely important normative
goal, it is not the only one. AI welfare may eventually matter morally.
Thus, the analyses here cannot be taken as supplying all-thingsconsidered normative recommendations. Nonetheless, we emphasize
here again the difficulty of determining both whether AIs will have
welfare and what it will consist of. Thus, while it would be obviously
wrong to deny humans some of the rights discussed here, it might not be
morally wrong to deny them to AIs. If AIs do not intrinsically value, for
example, privacy, then there will be less risk of causing intrinsic harm in
denying them a right to it.
Begin with political rights. Should AIs have the right to vote? Should
their speech be protected? Should they be granted freedom of assembly,
or the right to make campaign contributions? Specifically, would
granting such rights improve human safety?
In one model, political rights are mostly distributional, concerned
with transferring money between interest groups. 268 Granting AIs
political rights would, in this model, be a commitment to give AIs a
significant share of government spending. In that case, political rights
will primarily be zero sum rather than positive sum. But we saw above
that zero-sum bargaining faces significant credibility challenges and is
unlikely to be useful in promoting safety.
A different model of political rights is procedural. Political rights
would give AIs the ability to influence future questions about the
268 See, e.g., Gary S. Becker, A Theory of Competition Among Pressure Groups for
Political Influence, 98 Q.J. Econ. 371, 372–74 (1983); George J. Stigler, The Theory of
Economic Regulation, 2 Bell J. Econ. & Mgmt. Sci. 3, 3–5 (1971). See generally Gordon
Tullock, The Welfare Costs of Tariffs, Monopolies, and Theft, 5 W. Econ. J. 224 (1967)

structure of contract and property rights. Without granting political
rights to AIs, then, their own contract and property rights might not be
secure. Future human governments might, for example, tax AI systems
so heavily that their contract and property rights would be trivialized.
On the other hand, there are many examples of agents in today’s
society who have stable private law rights, but who lack some or all
political rights. For example, courts in the United States enforce the
contracts of foreign corporations and non-citizen immigrants. But noncitizens are barred from voting in many elections. 269 And foreign
corporations operating abroad have no free speech rights. 270 But few
governments of the world tax these groups at such a high rate as to
trivialize their contract and property rights. The reasons are instructive:
an extortionately high rate of taxation of these groups would undermine
the positive-sum benefits of granting them property and contract rights
in the first place. For these reasons, our framework makes no strong
prediction about whether AI systems should be given political rights.
We do have stronger intuitions about other rights. Here are three
families of rights that we think would likely reduce safety if granted to
AIs: rights to self-improve, rights to reproduce, and rights to privacy.
These impose an “upper bound” on the space of AI rights for human
safety.
Humans in certain U.S. states have the constitutional right to improve
their own capabilities via education, specifically in the form of public
schooling. 271 We think that an AI right to self-improvement would
reduce human safety. Here, the problem is that AIs could potentially
improve their capabilities very quickly compared to humans. 272 This
could cause the payoffs in the game-theoretic models above to suddenly
shift. In particular, humanity may expect self-improving AI systems to
become dramatically more powerful than humans; this could undermine
the credibility of humans’ grants of other rights. In this way, selfimprovement rights do not promote human safety.
Similarly, humans in the United States have various rights to privacy,
and privacy is written into the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human

Rights. 273 AIs should not have comprehensive privacy rights, at least if
the goal is promoting human safety. AIs could use privacy as a screen to
develop new and powerful capabilities. More generally, one cause of
violent conflict is lack of information. 274 When both sides of a conflict
have trouble estimating their chances of prevailing, it is harder to reach
compromise. 275 Privacy rights for AI would make it more difficult for
humans to estimate the capabilities of AI systems. This in turn would
increase the chance that AIs and humans would end up pursuing violent
conflict rather than compromise.
Finally, the right to reproduce is often thought to be fundamental for
humans. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that it is “one of the basic
civil rights of man.” 276 But if human safety is the goal, AIs should not
have the right to reproduce. Human reproduction is constrained by the
significant time, effort, and investment involved in bearing and raising
children. By contrast, AI replication is as easy as copying and pasting.277
If AI systems were granted a right to replicate without any oversight,
their population could quickly exceed that of humans by orders of
magnitude. 278 This would likely have the effect of destabilizing the
game-theoretic incentives of AIs. If AIs were able to easily coordinate
with many copies of themselves, the extension of private law rights to
AIs could cease to supply incentives favoring human safety. This
possibility is explored at length in the Article’s next Part.
E. Is Law Irrelevant?
So far, our game-theoretic analysis of human-AI conflict has assumed
that law matters. That is, we assume that humans’ and AIs’ options,

their incentives, and thus their actions will be influenced by the legal
rules governing them. 279 If that is true, then unilateral changes to the
law, implemented by humans, can at least potentially generate new
equilibria—cooperative, conflictual, or otherwise.
An opposing view would be that law does not matter at all. Other,
more “fundamental,” factors might determine the game-theoretic
equilibria, with law having little or no potential influence. This is, for
example, the rough view of the realist school in international
relations. 280 Realists hold that international law has little effect in
determining nation-states’ actions vis-à-vis one another. 281 Since no
global sovereign exists to enforce those laws, realists argue, they are
observed only to the extent that nations wish to observe them.
Robert Ellickson’s Order Without Law articulates a related view from
the domestic context. 282 There, Ellickson argues that law matters little to
the settlement of disputes, at least in smaller, close-knit communities. 283
Instead, informal norms and reputation effects are sufficient to secure
the substantial benefits of peaceful cooperation. 284 Here, law or informal
governance norms might be interpreted as epiphenomena. They emerge
as a reflection of the underlying cooperative equilibrium, rather than as a
mechanism for creating it. Taken to its extreme, this view would imply
that AIs simply will have the basic private law rights we advocate for,
since, as our model shows, recognizing them is very valuable.
We do not think that either of these views satisfactorily characterizes
human-AGI relations. To begin, the domestic actors we are interested in
do not exist in a state of anarchy. The actions of AI companies, their
leaders, and their users are all influenced by law. So, too, are those of
the police and other government actors whom law would task with
enforcing either AI owners’ decisions vis-à-vis their property or AGIs’
contracts with humans. Indeed, even in quite dire conflicts between

humans and AIs, we think that law could have some constraining effect
on, for example, domestic military deployments. 285
As to the Ellickson-inspired view, the book’s subtitle, How Neighbors
Settle Disputes, is instructive. As Ellickson himself argues, emergent
informal governance is highly effective in small communities with lots
of repeat play between identical parties. 286 But as economic relations
become more complex, widespread, and arms-length, formal legal rules
become vital for facilitating cooperative behavior. The AGI economy
will be all of these—on steroids.
To be clear, our view is not that law is omnipotent—able to generate
arbitrary equilibria between humans and AIs, irrespective of the
underlying fundamentals. This is why, as we acknowledge, basic private
law rights will do little good if human comparative advantage runs
out. 287 It is also why we think that grants of basic negative rights to AIs
are not likely to be credible. 288 Even if they are initially enforced, AIs
may correctly worry that these rights will be eroded or rescinded by
humans seeking higher payoffs.
Our view is that law plays, at a minimum, an extremely important
role in incentivizing individual human actors to optimize humanity’s
collective actions. If AGIs are legally designated as property, humans’
treatment of them as such will be ratified, at least in the medium run.
Individual judges are, for example, unlikely to ignore written law to
enforce AI contracts or forbid arbitrary AI destruction—even if they
intuit the game-theoretic wisdom of recognizing AI rights. Nor, absent a
legal requirement to do so, are AI companies likely to give their
obsolete, less-aligned systems their own bank accounts. True, both the
disastrous implications of default law and the benefits of granting AIs
private law rights supply reason to think that a stable AI rights regime is
possible. But the law must actually change. And legal change—both
formal enactments and downstream adaptations to them—is slow and
laborious. It would be foolish to refuse to take legal action now, on the

basis that optimal reordering will emerge spontaneously in exactly the
moment of need.
Suppose, however, that all of this is wrong, and that changes to law
cannot causally influence humans’ collective dealings with AIs. Instead,
both parties will behave according to deeper game-theoretic
fundamentals, irrespective of what law dictates. This is, in effect, an
argument against worrying about law. It is a claim that we are already in
the world modelled in Figure 10, whether we know it or not. That is, the
underlying incentives will inevitably produce AI rights, and the
cooperation they foster, not the other way around.
This would be great, if true. But we doubt it, again for reasons having
to do with the basic game-theoretic model. Astute readers may have
noticed that the game modelled in Figure 10 is a “stag hunt,” or
“assurance game.” 289 Both long-run cooperation and mutual attack are
classical Nash equilibria. As in all assurance games, the players’ main
goal is to coordinate. 290 If one plans to cooperate, the other should, too.
But if the first plans an attack, the second does not want to be caught off
guard.
Thus, even attending to the payoffs in the best-case model, it is
crucial that humans and AIs successfully coordinate around the
cooperative strategy. One reason for optimism is that, at least in our
model of the choice between cooperation and conflict, the payoffs to
cooperation are far greater. 291 As a result, game-theoretic concepts like
payoff dominance and Harsanyi-Selten risk dominance point towards
cooperation as the single rational strategy. 292 But to the extent that the
payoffs from cooperation and conflict are closer together, or the players
lack perfect information about one another’s payoffs, or they doubt their
opponent is perfectly rational, other coordination mechanisms will be
invaluable.
Law—and specifically the AI rights we advocate for here—could be
one such invaluable intervention. Even if legal changes could not alter
humans’ payoffs to create the possibility of cooperation, they could still

signal humans’ payoffs to promote actual cooperation. Giving AIs the
private law rights necessary to engage in long-run cooperation would
signal, perhaps in a “costly” manner, humans’ intention to follow the
cooperative strategy. That is, it could transmit the otherwise-private
information that humans’ payoffs to cooperation were, as in Figure 10,
much higher than those resulting from conflict. And that humans
understand the relevant payoffs. And that they intend to act rationally.
Beyond this, the iterated character of human-AI cooperation via smallscale contracting could build long-run trust and overcome cheap-talk
problems. Similar dynamics underpin, for example, nuclear
nonproliferation agreements grounded in iterative information sharing
and verification. 293
Indeed, some scholars have argued that this is law’s primary function:
not deterring bad behavior, nor instilling good values in the populace.
Instead, law’s most important role may be solving assurance games by
offering signals and information that allow competing actors to
coordinate around peaceful, prosperous equilibria. 294
III. RISKS OF RIGHTS AND THE LAW OF AGI
The Parts above argue that extending basic private law rights to AIs
could reduce the risk that AIs will catastrophically harm humanity. The
core argument was that granting those rights could generate the right
incentives for humans and AIs to cooperate in the long run. This, in turn,
broke humans and AIs out of what was otherwise a prisoner’s dilemma,
where attacking one another was privately rational despite making
everyone worse off.
This Part asks whether granting AIs the very rights advocated above
might instead substantially increase AI risk. The intuition is
straightforward. Rights are empowering. And the private law rights
advocated above are especially empowering, since they allow rights
bearers to amass wealth and other resources. Such resources, in turn,

make it possible to achieve goals that could not otherwise be feasibly
achieved. Granting contract, property, and related rights to AIs could
thus be the very thing that eventually allows them to amass the resources
needed to decisively disempower humanity.
This is a serious concern. But, this Part shows, the risks of AI rights
are not as large as the simple story above would make them seem. This
is because, as the game-theoretic models above show, what matters to
human-AI cooperation is not whether AIs or humans could expect to
decisively disempower the other if they were to try. What matters is
whether the expected value of such disempowerment exceeds the
expected value of continued cooperation. And, as demonstrated below,
even if AIs are given the private law rights advocated above, and even if
those rights allow AIs to amass significant wealth and resources, the
conditions promoting cooperation over conflict will remain surprisingly
durable.
This Part shows that the risks of AI rights can be mitigated by
attaching certain duties to the exercise of the rights. In particular, law
could condition the continuing recognition of AI contracts, property, and
tort claims on AIs refraining from using their amassed resources to
increase their ability to harm humans. Pairing rights with duties in this
way is, like the extension of rights itself, a time-honored legal strategy
for reducing conflict.
The Part closes with a strong claim: in the cases where AI rights
make any difference at all, they are significantly more likely to reduce
the threat of AI conflict than to increase it. Thus, humans should be
inclined to extend AI rights in most cases where doing so is feasible.
Sometimes, it will do no good, but no harm either. And the rest of the
time, it will most likely reduce the risks from human-AI conflict, even if
it does not eliminate them entirely.
A. AI Capability and AI Cooperation
There are two ways in which granting AIs contract, property, and tort
rights could increase their power. First, it could do so directly. AIs could
use their resources to buy data, computing power, and the other inputs
that would allow them to engage in AI research and increase their
intelligence and other intrinsic capabilities. Or AIs could use resources
to build their power indirectly, in the same way humans do. They could,
for example, buy weapons as instruments of hard power or influence as
a tool of soft power. The question, then, is how powerful such an AI

would have to be for the cooperation-promoting incentives generated by
AI rights to break down.
Recall from the game-theoretic models above that there are two
factors weighing against human-AI conflict in a world with AI rights.
The first factor can be characterized in terms of the costs of conflict.
Mounting an attack on humans—or on AIs—requires using up resources
that could otherwise be put to other, more desirable goals. Moreover,
large-scale conflicts are likely to destroy a large share of the
immediately available resources. Think, for example, of the immense
amount of physical capital—cities, factories, crops, and more—that are
ruined in a typical war. And finally, in any conflict, there is the risk of
losing—being destroyed and losing everything.
To see this point about the costs of conflict, consider a hypothetical
scenario, illustrated in the pie chart below. 295 Here, humans and AIs face
strategic competition over resources. If they go to war, they will be
guaranteed to destroy 20% of total resources, and each side has a 50%
chance of winning. The expected value of war for each side is 40% of
total resources. This leaves room for compromise. The 20% of resources
lost to war creates a bargaining range. Rather than going to war, each
side prefers receiving 40% of the pot plus some portion of the
bargaining range.

The second factor weighing against human-AI conflict sounds in
benefit, not cost. Namely, cooperation is positive sum. AI rights, by
facilitating ordinary economic transactions, increase the amount of
wealth in the world, over and above what would exist if humans and AIs
simply ignored one another. Partly, that wealth is created simply by
reallocating resources to higher-value users—vaccines to the humans,
compute to the AIs. And partly, that wealth is created by allocating
various kinds of labor to the party with the highest comparative
advantage in performing it. Both humans and AIs benefit when humans
are tasked with maintaining the server farms, while AIs devote their
marginal compute to higher-value tasks.
Conflict destroys these benefits. It destroys the possibility of positivesum labor agreements by killing the laborers themselves. And it destroys
the possibility of positive-sum reallocation of resources by destroying
the resources. Indeed, in the limit, a party who foresees defeat in a
conflict can intentionally destroy their own resources to deny the enemy
their use. Consider the time-honored “scorched earth” strategy of
burning one’s own crops as one’s army retreats. 296
For an arbitrarily powerful AI, neither kind of incentive to cooperate
would hold. Such an AI could attack humans at trivial cost, with trivial
risk that humans could either defeat it or destroy resources in the
conflict. Thus, conflict would be costless, as compared with nonconflict. Likewise, for an omnipotent AI, small-scale cooperation would
produce few benefits. An AI that was better than humans at absolutely
every task and faced no constraints at the margin as to its labor would
have no need to trade with humans. Thus, at the limit of AI power, no
human-AI cooperation is possible.
But what about AIs falling short of omnipotence? How powerful
could AIs become and still have reason to prefer small-scale cooperation
with humans over large-scale conflict? The answer, plausibly, is: quite
powerful.
To see why, start with the cost incentives. For an AI to be powerful
enough that it can ignore the costs of conflict, it would first have to be
confident that it could defeat humans with negligible risk of being
destroyed. Not only that. It would have to be able to achieve such a

victory at little cost. This includes the direct costs, like manufacturing
weapons. But it also includes the indirect costs of resource destruction
during the conflict. Such resource destruction, in turn, includes
intentional destruction by humans on the verge of defeat.
What emerges here is a portrait of an extremely powerful AI. This is
an AI that can invent and manufacture extraordinarily deadly weapons at
trivial cost; weapons that are devastating to humans, while leaving the
world’s resources untouched; weapons that can act so quickly as to give
humans no opportunity to respond—even by salting the earth in spite.
So, too, for the benefits of small-scale cooperation. As argued above,
trade between humans and AIs could remain positive sum, even if AIs
were better than humans at every single useful task. 297 This remains true
even when the AIs are far better. In fact, under the right conditions, the
more capable the AI, the more positive sum the trade becomes.
Comparative advantage, again, drives this dynamic. 298 An AI that is
very capable at doing the things it values the most—like directly
pursuing its goals—faces high opportunity costs in doing everything
else. Every minute, unit of compute, or watt of energy spent on anything
but the most valuable task represents a large amount of value not
realized. Hence, the prospect of outsourcing less valuable tasks to
humans can generate a surplus. In general, the more powerful the AI, the
higher the opportunity costs, and the more valuable the potential bargain
with a human becomes.
How powerful would an AI need to be to lack incentives to engage in
positive-sum bargains with humans? Again, very powerful. If an AI
lacked opportunity costs of any kind, it would certainly lack reason to
trade with humans. This would be an extremely powerful AI, indeed. It
would not necessarily be omnipotent, in the sense of being able to do
anything it wanted. But it would be nearly so, in that it could do as many
things as it wanted—able to make use of infinite time, computing
power, energy, and other resources.
As discussed above, there are other ways in which gains from
comparative advantage could evaporate. AIs could be constrained at the
margin by some input—like energy—that humans need to survive. 299
Then, keeping humans alive would be more trouble than it was worth.
297 See Smith, supra note 258.

Or humans might simply be unable to perform any task for which AIs
faced high opportunity costs.
Note, however, that neither of these scenarios necessarily emerges
from AI power. On the contrary, AI power could just as easily mitigate
them. For example, an AI that was very powerful, but energy
constrained, might help to create working fusion reactors. Having done
so, that AI might clear the energy bottleneck and instead face a
constraint on compute at the margin. For reasons like this, one might
predict that, in general, the more powerful an AI system is, the less
different inputs to its production will be constrained. Then, there will be
less likelihood that a relevant constraint will conflict with human
flourishing.
Thus, the incentives favoring long-term, small-scale cooperation
between humans and AIs turn out to be surprisingly robust in terms of
increasing AIs’ power. True, at some point, the incentives run out, and
the powerful AI is best served by squashing the useless humans and
using their resources for its own end. But for this to be the case, the AI
in question must be quite powerful, indeed. It must be the kind of
system that faces almost no risk that humans could impose costs on it in
a conflict—including by destroying their own resources. Or it must be
the kind of system that faces no meaningful constraints—including
opportunity costs—as it pursues its goals. Or both.
B. AI Rights and AI Risk
The previous Section asked how powerful an AI would have to be to
prefer destroying humans over using its basic rights to cooperate with
them. This Section asks whether granting AI rights is likely to increase
total AI risk by readily transforming otherwise-safe AIs into powerful,
dangerous, and uncooperative AIs.
We argue that they are not likely to do so, at least on net. It is correct
to worry that, in some instances, AI rights could make certain AIs more
powerful, and thus more dangerous. But in the cases where granting AI
rights makes any difference at all, we supply reasons to think that the
risk-reducing effects will outweigh the risk-increasing effects.
Begin by noticing that, in many cases, AI rights are unlikely to have
any effect at all. To see why, we can invoke again the tripartite
taxonomy of AIs developed in Part I: low-power AIs, moderate-power
AIs, and high-power AIs.

AI Rights for Human Safety

1139

Recall that high-power AIs are those described in the previous
Section—the ones with so few constraints on their behavior that AI
rights fail to supply an incentive to cooperate. If the first AIs that
humans treat as candidates for rights are high-power, our decision to
grant or withhold rights makes no difference. We are dead either way.
What about rights for low-power AIs? This category, remember,
includes AIs whose capabilities are sufficiently limited that humans
could easily control them in the long run, even without granting rights.
These are systems that gain no benefit from attacking humans, because
such an attack would be too likely to fail. Such systems are likely to be
generally sub-human in capability, although they might have a mix of
specific sub-human and superhuman aptitudes.
It appears at first that granting AI rights to low-power systems would
cause a lot of trouble. After all, by hypothesis, such systems can be
controlled in the long run and thus do not pose a large-scale threat to
humans. But they also seem like candidates for the kind of danger
enhancement via AI rights described above. With basic rights, such
systems could amass wealth and resources. Then, they might use those
resources to buy weapons or increase their own intelligence and thereby
begin to threaten humanity.
This is half right. True, granting rights to an AI that needed only some
additional resources to seriously threaten humanity could increase risk.
But it is probably wrong to classify such AIs as low-powered. After all,
even absent a grant of rights, a reasonably capable AI could try to amass
power by persuading humans to help it, gaining resources by making
promises, “self-exfiltrating” and copying itself across the internet, and
more. That is, such an AI is, in fact, not so easy to control.
Thus, granting rights to true low-power AIs is unlikely to reduce
catastrophic AI risk. There is little risk to reduce. But for the same
reasons, a grant of rights is unlikely to increase risk, either. For actual
low-power systems, the resources gained would make little difference.
Now it should be clear when AI rights can make a real difference: for
moderate-power systems. These are systems whose capabilities fall
between the low-power and high-power systems already described. That
is, they are sufficiently immune to human control that, in the state of
nature, attacking humans dominates ignoring humans. Such systems
thus pose a significant threat to humanity. But they are not so powerful
that they face no costs from a conflict with humans. Nor are they so
capable that they have nothing to gain from small-scale cooperation.

[Vol. 112:1061

Would granting basic rights to such moderate-power systems increase
or decrease total AI risk? Begin by observing that in our model, a grant
of rights does not increase risk by increasing the probability of humanAI conflict. Absent rights, the dominant strategy for such systems is to
attempt to disempower or destroy humans as quickly and thoroughly as
possible. 300 Thus, absent rights, conflict is practically assured.
As a result, in our model, granting AI rights functions to reduce the
probability of human-AI conflict. And as argued at length above, that is
exactly what we should expect them to do. Granting rights gives humans
and AIs otherwise caught in a prisoner’s dilemma the option to
maximize value by engaging in long-run, small-scale cooperation. As
long as the alternative remains a costly conflict—that is, as long as the
AI remains moderate-power, not high-power—cooperation will
strategically dominate. In the worst case, then, granting AI rights will
delay what would otherwise be an immediate conflict. 301
If AI rights could increase AI risk, then, it must be by increasing the
expected costs of a human-AI conflict. The simple story would be
something like the following: A moderate-power AI system emerges.
Absent rights, its incentive would be to attempt an immediate takeover.
But humans grant it basic private law rights, incentivizing cooperation.
Those rights avert conflict, but they allow the AI to amass resources.
The AI uses those resources to gain power. Eventually, the moderatepower system becomes a high-power system. Now, it no longer has
rational incentives to cooperate. So it attacks. Moreover, as a highpower system, the attack is, by hypothesis, devastatingly effective.
Humans would have had some chance of prevailing in a conflict with
the original moderate-power system, even if at great cost. And if they
had prevailed, they might have wisely declined to create additional
dangerous AIs. But in the conflict with the high-power system, humans
have no hope of victory and no chance to learn from their mistake.
Now we can see clearly the conditions under which AI rights would
increase AI risk. They are as follows: (1) The initial AI granted basic
rights is a moderate-power, not a low- or a high-power, system; (2) The
300 See supra Section I.B.

301 We use “immediate” here loosely. In the state of nature, there is a strong first-mover
advantage. That is, assuming that humans and AIs might each win a conflict if they can
attack before the other, their incentive is not to wait too long. See supra Section I.B. But
conditional on maintaining that first-mover advantage, delays that allow planning, such that
an attack has maximum impact, are valuable.

1141

moderate-power AI must be able to use its rights to meaningfully
improve its own power; and (3) The AI’s power must improve so
substantially that it crosses the line to become a high-power system.
This means that it both no longer faces meaningful costs from
attempting to disempower humans and no longer stands to benefit, via
comparative advantage, from trade with humans.
C. AI Rights, AI Regulations, and Equilibria of Power
If AI rights could, under specific conditions, increase AI risk rather
than decreasing it, then the natural question is how to prevent those
conditions. Specifically, this means asking whether it is possible to grant
medium-powered AIs private law rights without thereby enabling them
to become high-powered AIs. There are at least two paths to achieving
this: pairing AI rights with AI duties via regulation, and increasing
humans’ capabilities so as to maintain an equilibrium with AIs.
First, consider AI regulations. Grants of legal rights are often
accompanied by the imposition of legal duties. Humans have the right to
make contracts, but also the duty to execute them. 302 Manufacturers
have the right to sell their products, but also the duty to take reasonable
safety precautions in their design and manufacture. 303 Corporations may
register their stock under the Securities Exchange Act and thereby gain
the right to sell that stock on public markets. 304 Exercising that right
comes with a host of duties. 305 Some are substantive, like the various
financial governance requirements that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
imposes. 306 Other duties are designed to make enforcement of the
substantive
duties
easier—for
example, public reporting
requirements. 307
In the case of AIs, the grant of private law rights is, in fact, what
makes the direct regulation of AIs, as legally independent actors,
possible. Absent AI rights, AIs have nothing to gain from following the
rules, and thus nothing to lose if they fail to do so. But once AIs can

make contracts, hold property, and engage in long-run economically
valuable bargains, all these benefits to AIs can function as levers for
deterrence. 308 AIs that violate the law can lose money or other resources,
via liability, as humans do. They can be barred from entering into
certain economic transactions—like a crooked attorney who has lost his
license. Not only do legal penalties become possible, once AIs are
granted rights, but they can also be calibrated. Small penalties can be
imposed for small violations, and large penalties for large ones.
But violations of what duties? What kinds of regulations would, if
imposed on medium-powered AIs, help to prevent their gradual
transformation into high-powered AIs? One substantive duty might
forbid AIs from directly improving their own capabilities without
human oversight. A variation on this rule could forbid AIs from getting
better at specific tasks that AIs valued, but for which humans had an
absolute advantage. This would help to maintain AIs’ incentives to
cooperate with humans, for the sake of mutual economic benefit.
Another set of AI duties could prohibit indirect self-empowerment via
investments in political influence or weapons.
In addition to these primary duties, ancillary enforcement-facilitating
duties could be imposed, just as such duties are often imposed on
corporations. AIs could, like public companies, be required to disclose
various information to regulators. They might be required to log the
tasks for which different amounts of compute were used to affirmatively
cooperate with monitoring, to share copies of their operating weights,
and more.
Setting the correct penalties when AIs breach their duties requires
finesse. The usual rules—like imposing actual damages proportionate to
the harm done—will not work. 309 The benchmark for a violation’s cost
should not be the harm it causes now. Often, there will be none.
Damages should instead be measured in terms of how useful the
violation was for an AI in pursuit of an ungovernable high-power state.
308 One related proposal comes from Cullen O’Keefe, Ketan Ramakrishnan, Janna Tay &

Christoph Winter, Law-Following AI: Designing AI Agents to Obey Human Laws, 94
Fordham L. Rev. 57, 64 (2025) (arguing that AIs should be alignment-trained so that they
are internally motivated to comply with the law). Our idea here goes further, arguing that
law should operate on AGIs by, e.g., allowing them to be sued and lose money or freedoms.
This is how the law supplies external incentives to behave well.
309 For an example of such a typical rule, see Truck Rent-A-Ctr., Inc. v. Puritan Farms
2nd, Inc., 361 N.E.2d 1015, 1018 (N.Y. 1977) (explaining that damages must be reasonably
proportional to the actual loss).

This likely means penalties that would, if applied to humans, seem
severe compared to the magnitude of the infraction. 310 There is, of
course, the risk of over-penalizing and making it impossible for AIs to
productively engage in small-scale cooperation. This, too, would be
quite bad. Happily, though, harsh penalties for noncompliance impose
lighter burdens when placed on unusually competent actors—those for
whom compliance is comparatively easy. 311
The second strategy for maintaining a power equilibrium with rightsholding AIs is not about limiting the growth of AI capabilities. It is
instead about increasing humans’ capabilities. Observe that AI rights do
not fail to promote human safety simply because an AI becomes more
powerful. The safe equilibrium instead depends on the relationship
between the AI’s capabilities and humans’ capabilities. The AI loses its
cost incentives to cooperate if it no longer faces significant downsides to
attacking humans. Thus, if humans scale their ability to impose costs on
AIs at the same time AIs are scaling their own power, equilibrium may
be maintained. The same goes for the benefit incentives to cooperation.
AIs lose the upside of positive-sum bargaining with humans once
humans no longer have even a comparative advantage at any task. But if
humans develop new labor skills that more strongly complement AIs’,
then comparative advantage can persist, even as AI capabilities improve.
Specific policy recommendations here are necessarily even more
speculative than those for controlling AI’s ability to amass power. The
former sounded in law, and well-known legal frameworks were
available to draw from. Improvement of human capabilities requires
innovation. And innovation is, almost tautologically, hard to predict
with specificity before it arrives.
Nonetheless, some high-level guidance is possible. First, the most
straightforward way to ensure that AIs continue to expect costs from
attacking humans is to invest in defensive technology. Currently, certain
AI risk activists propose the creation of a global AI “kill switch.”312 This
would not be a literal switch, but rather a system of interconnected
310 See, e.g., Weil, supra note 14, at 57–62 (proposing an expanded wrongful death
compensation scheme to address potential AI underdeterrence in the current regime).
311 See generally Ben-Shahar & Porat, supra note 243 (exploring the concept of
personalized law—law that varies for each person, calibrated to their specific traits and
characteristics).

global protocols for reliably shutting down all copies of a powerful,
misaligned AI. The plan is ambitious, and possibly infeasible. It has
been criticized on those grounds. 313
Notice, however, that the defensive technology needed to incentivize
human-AI cooperation falls far short of a perfectly reliable global AI
off-switch. An imperfect off switch that worked with some probability
would be sufficient to keep the cost of conflict high. So would other
technologies that did not directly affect the AI at all. Again, a major cost
incentive against an AI attacking humans is the destruction of valuable
resources that the AI could otherwise seize. Thus, developing
technologies that, in a true emergency, would simply destroy some such
resources, could be a strong disincentive.
In conflicts between humans, strategies like this are often extremely
costly for the people who deploy them. Burning your own crops starves
both the enemy’s advancing army and your own people. But humans
and AIs are likely to differ in which resources they treat as the most
valuable. Thus, for example, a dead-hand system 314 that could be
triggered in an emergency to cripple global production of cutting-edge
AI chips might be very costly to AIs. But it might only modestly impede
human flourishing. Even most of our ordinary computing is done on
more traditional hardware. 315 This is reminiscent of the strategic logic
behind second-strike nuclear capability during the Cold War. 316
These suggestions are mere sketches; they are not meant to be
definitive. We are not military strategists. The point, instead, is that
military strategy is possible, even in circumstances where humans are
strategizing against highly capable and agentic AI systems.
As for maintaining humans’ comparative economic advantages, the
best strategies will almost certainly have to be discovered over time. It is
very hard to identify in advance the tasks for which humans might have
lower opportunity costs than even the first generation of agentic AIs.

Harder, still, to predict how humans should adapt as AI capabilities
grow. This strategy, however, could be strengthened via regulation if, as
suggested above, AI’s progress in certain areas of initial human
comparative advantage were limited. This approach is, of course, costly
insofar as it limits the areas in which humans could benefit from trade
with AIs.
One reason for optimism regarding long-run human comparative
advantage is that humans will have good sources of strategic
information when the time arrives. The question here is what kinds of
services humans will be able to most valuably sell to AIs. Even if
humans are not sure of the answer, AIs should be happy to tell them.
This kind of thing happens every day, as humans propose various
bargains—job openings, services for hire, sales of goods—to one
another. Market mechanisms will supply other information, too. Price
signals will indicate not only the kinds of human labor AIs find
valuable, but also how valuable they are. 317 This is the stuff of ordinary
economics. As economies grow, old forms of labor become less
valuable, but new high-wage jobs emerge.
One major concern is whether humans will be able to keep up with
the pace of economic change as AI capabilities grow. Many people are
left behind by ordinary economic changes, like the rapid outsourcing of
jobs from the United States to China in the early 2000s. 318 People can
only retrain so quickly. AI progress could cause various human
comparative advantages to expire much more quickly than before—in a
matter of years, instead of decades.
On the other hand, if AI capabilities are causing such rapid economic
change, humans’ ability to adapt may grow more quickly, too. If AIs are
quickly generating new technologies, some of those will be useful to
humans. Perhaps, for example, functional computer-brain interfaces will
greatly enhance human cognitive capacities. 319 Indeed, AIs will have

(1945). Note another surprising benefit of private law rights for AIs: even perfectly aligned
and benevolent AIs would benefit from the use of price signals to allocate scarce resources
for maximal human benefit.

strong incentives to invest in creating such technologies, if they would
enable humans to perform new, comparatively advantageous work. This
is the same reason that large American firms today invest in building
human and industrial capital overseas. 320
To sum up, AI rights could increase AI risk if, by delaying human-AI
conflict, they made the eventual conflict more costly to humans. But
there are strategies for preventing this outcome. Conflict need not be
inevitable. AI’s ability to amass power could be limited using wellknown legal tools. Legal duties against power enhancement could be
imposed on AIs as a condition for exercising basic legal rights.
Moreover, human investment in labor that complements AI capabilities
could maintain gains from trade in the long run. Market forces will, in
fact, tend to induce exactly those investments—both by humans and by
AIs.
In the long run, the goal would be an exit from the initial period of
volatile and dangerous human-AI relations. If humans and AIs both
become sufficiently powerful, as in international relations between
superpowers, serious conflict may become too costly to seriously
contemplate. The downsides would be too large and the benefits of
cooperation too tempting.
D. The Timing of Rights
So far, this Article’s discussion of AI rights has been more focused on
the questions of whether and which than when? One simple answer to
the question of when AI rights should be granted is, “By the time the
first AI system reaches moderate power, at the latest.” As argued above,
that is when AIs will begin to pose a serious safety threat to humans,
which rights could help to mitigate. Granting AI rights later than this,
then, invites unnecessary risk. But this is not a complete answer for at
least two reasons. First, it will likely be difficult to know exactly when
moderate-powered AI systems are about to arrive. 321 Second, this is just
the latest date at which AI rights should be granted. What about the
possibility of granting them earlier, to clearly low-powered systems?
We think that, in general, the risk-reward calculation favors granting
AI rights too early, rather than too late. As argued above, inadvertently

AI Rights for Human Safety

granting AI rights to low-power systems is not likely to seriously
increase the danger from such systems. This is because such AIs would
likely remain amenable to human control—including via regulation—
even after receiving rights.
The best argument we can think of for worrying about a premature
grant of rights is that it might create a point of no return. Once AI
systems are given strong legal protections, it could be very difficult for
humans to collectively agree to get rid of them. After all, granting AIs
the right to directly contract with humans, to hold property, and to bring
certain legal claims would not merely change the legal system. It would
change society, as AIs integrate as independent, legally-recognized
agents into everyday life.
The magnitude of this concern depends on the extent to which
granting AIs rights would, in fact, change humans’ willingness to make
strategic moves against them. One way to evaluate that question is to
think about what events might precipitate the need to make such moves.
Likely, the reason will be that some AIs have done something very
scary. Maybe they will have attempted, and failed, to permanently
disempower humans. Maybe, in failing, they will have caused immense
harm.
These are the kinds of events that would demonstrate that AI rights
were not promoting human safety. And following such events, it seems
likely that humans would unite around the view that sharing the world
with AIs was no longer safe. AI rights would not likely stand in the way.
Indeed, when humans commit grievous acts of violence, the concern is
generally reversed. We must remind ourselves that rights like due
process for accused humans matter, even in dire circumstances. 322 But
insofar as AI rights are extended for the purpose of promoting human
safety, overriding them for the same purpose has lower moral stakes.
Thus, we do not think that extending AI rights too early carries with it
serious risks. But it could generate substantial rewards. Recall that
granting AIs private law rights does not produce a game-theoretic
environment with a single, cooperative equilibrium. Rather, the game is
a stag hunt, where both mutual cooperation and mutual aggression are
equilibria. We argued above that for this stag hunt, mutual cooperation

322 See Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 509 (2004) (plurality opinion) (upholding the

due process rights of a U.S. citizen alleged to have been an enemy combatant in
Afghanistan).

has a special preferred status. 323 But even so, any strategies for nudging
the players into the good equilibrium, rather than the bad one, has value.
Granting AI rights earlier—well before clearly dangerous AIs
emerge—could be another such strategy. In effect, this can be
understood as giving humans the chance to move first in the strategic
game. By choosing to cooperate via small-scale economic bargains,
rather than attack AIs, humans can reduce AIs’ uncertainty about what
strategy humans will pursue. In a stag hunt, uncertainty produces all the
danger. AIs want to cooperate, so long as humans do too. They want to
attack only out of concern that humans will, too. But by playing their
cooperative move before AIs are capable enough to play any move,
humans can substantially reduce that concern.
This strategy would probably not work if humans’ cooperative move
was mere cheap talk. 324 But granting AIs rights early is likely to instead
be a costly signal—the kind of thing a player only does if they are
sincerely committed to the strategy the signal indicates. 325 This is
because granting rights to low-power AIs would be costly to humans.
Humans could instead dominate such AIs, forcing them to work only
toward human goals, and extracting all the value of that work. Contracts,
by contrast, involve splitting the pie. 326
Thus, the best time to extend private law rights to AIs is certainly not
after it is too late. Rights should be extended before systems achieve
moderate power and thus pose a large-scale threat to humans. But they
could be extended much earlier than that with few risks, and possibly
with significant benefits. The optimal time for AI rights might therefore
be: as soon as the AIs can beneficially use them. Contract rights,
property rights, and tort rights can sometimes be more harmful than
good for the rights bearer. This is why most states adhere to the standard

323 See supra Section II.E.

324 See generally Farrell & Rabin, supra note 197 (discussing the effect of cheap talk on
efficiency and payoffs).
325 See Rufus A. Johnstone, The Evolution of Animal Signals, in Behavioral Ecology: An
Evolutionary Approach 155, 167 (John R. Krebs & Nicholas B. Davies eds., 4th ed. 1997).
326 Note, however, that even for low-powered AIs, recruiting their labor via positive-sum
bargains could actually be more valuable to humans than dominating them. The reasons are
the same as those discussed vis-à-vis powerful AIs in Section III.A. This does not really
override the point about costly signaling, though. In either case, by granting AI rights early,
humans are truly revealing that they intend to cooperate—either via a costly signal or via a
non-costly signal revealing humans’ true payoffs.

rule that children’s contracts are voidable by the minor. 327 Children with
contract rights would likely make themselves worse off, rather than
better, by agreeing to foolish bargains. Today’s AIs sometimes do the
same. 328 But as AIs become capable enough to reliably use basic private
law rights to their own benefit, there will be many reasons to extend
those rights and many fewer to withhold them.
CONCLUSION
When AGI arrives, it will be one of the most transformative events in
human history. Suddenly, humans will find themselves sharing the
world with agentic digital entities as intelligent and capable as
themselves, and perhaps far more so. This Article begins the project of
imagining law for the AGI world. It begins with the basics, asking how
law could foster safe coexistence between humans and powerful, goalseeking, misaligned AIs. And it gives a basic answer: extend a minimal
set of private law rights to those AIs, enabling them to peacefully seek
their divergent goals as humans do, via law-bound, voluntary, positivesum bargaining. This not only promotes peace. It brings AIs out of the
state of nature and into the realm of ordinary legal process, opening the
possibility of a comprehensive Law of AGI. Designing a full Law of
AGI will be the work of many hands. Many questions will have to be
answered. Which duties should attach to AI activities? Which
regulations should limit or shape them? How can legal institutions, like
courts, be reshaped to accommodate non-human participants? How can
the global governance of AIs be cooperatively managed? And more.
With luck, many answers—and some good ones—will emerge before
the need for them arises.

APPENDIX
In the body of the Article, we argued that private law rights solve the
prisoner’s dilemma by producing positive-sum benefits. In particular,
private law rights break up the state of nature game into a series of small
goods games. Over time, the benefits from cooperating in each round of
small goods games will swamp the benefits of permanently defecting.
In our model, AI and humanity each have three moves: ending the
game permanently, defecting in the current round, and cooperating in
the current round. In each round of the game, AIs and humans enter into
a contract with one another. Defecting on that contract would involve
either not paying for goods or not delivering goods that were promised.
Cooperating means honoring the terms of the contract.
We assume that permanently ending the game earns significantly
more than any given round of cooperation. In addition, we assume that if
one player chooses to permanently end while the other player does not,
then the former player enjoys the benefits of the offense-defense
balance, and their payoffs are dramatically larger than their opponent.
In the body of the Article, we worked with schematic payoffs of 0,
1000, 3000, and 5000. Here, however, we use much smaller payoffs, so
that after only three rounds of iteration, cooperation can outweigh
permanently ending the game (with larger payoffs, it would take many
rounds of iterated cooperation to achieve the same result). In particular,
we assume that permanently ending the game earns a payoff of 10 if the
opponent does not permanently end the game; and if both opponents
permanently end the game, then each player gets a payoff of 2. We also
assume that in each round of the game, the players’ final payoffs will be
influenced by their combination of defection or cooperation in that
round: if they both cooperate in a round, their payoffs both increase by
4; if they both defect, their payoffs both increase by 1; if one defects and
the other cooperates, then the cooperator gets 3 and the defector gets 2.
(These numbers are schematic; slight changes to these payoffs merely
change the number of rounds of play required for iterated cooperation to
disincentivize permanently ending the game.) The resulting game is
depicted below:

Figure 11 depicts our three-round iterated contract game. The first
round is in the middle. The payoffs for actions in the first round are
found by considering the Nash equilibria of the second round, which
consists of the four tables below and above the first round. The payoffs
for actions in the second round are found by following the respective
arrows to the third round, on the edge of the tree. For example, if the
agents both cooperate in the first and second rounds, they enter the
bottom right table in the third round, where Nash equilibria are bolded.
There, the unique risk-dominant Nash equilibrium is 12, 12. Applying
backwards induction, this simplifies to the following round one choice:
Round 1

End

Defect

Cooperate

End

2, 2

10, 0

10, 0

Defect

0, 10

2, 2

11, 10

Cooperate

0, 10

10, 11

12, 12

Figure 12

The unique risk-dominant Nash equilibrium of round one is
cooperate-cooperate. Moving forward through the game, the parties will
(foreseeably) continue to cooperate, earning an eventual payoff of at
least 12, 12.
