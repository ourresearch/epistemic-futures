ABSTRACT1
This report presents the initial findings of Microsoft’s research
initiative on “AI and Productivity”, which seeks to measure and
accelerate the productivity gains created by LLM-powered
productivity tools like Microsoft’s Copilot. The many studies
summarized in this report, the initiative’s first, focus on common
enterprise information worker tasks for which LLMs are most
likely to provide significant value. Results from the studies support
the hypothesis that the first versions of Copilot tools substantially
increase productivity on these tasks. This productivity boost
usually appeared in the studies as a meaningful increase in speed of
execution without a significant decrease in quality. Furthermore,
we observed that the willingness-to-pay for LLM-based tools is
higher for people who have used the tools than those who have not,
suggesting that the tools provide value above initial expectations.
The report also highlights future directions for the AI and
Productivity initiative, including an emphasis on approaches that
capture a wider range of tasks and roles.

Introduction

One of the most significant ways that technological advances help
improve quality of life is by enabling step-function improvements
in labor productivity [6,8]. Many have hypothesized that recent
improvements in large language models (LLMs) and applications
built on LLMs would provide such a productivity boost, and a
historically large one at that (e.g., [4,6]). Early evidence mostly
supported this hypothesis, with productivity gains seen in various
types of lab studies when workers were provided with LLM-based
tools [7,10,18,22,23,25].
Microsoft has invested significantly in building productivity tools
based on LLMs (branded “Copilot”), in large part based on the
hypothesis that such tools would substantially increase the
productivity of information workers. In concert with building these
tools, Microsoft also formed a cross-company research team (the
“AI and Productivity” research team) that seeks to measure and

accelerate the productivity gains provided by these tools. As
Copilot has started to become a reality, this team – from which this
paper emerges – began to explore one of the first research questions
that needs to be answered to advance our broader mandate:
RQ: What impact does Copilot have on productivity for
common enterprise information worker tasks for which
LLMs have been hypothesized to provide significant value?
Importantly, for this stage of work, we did not seek to evaluate
Copilot’s (or LLM’s) overall increase in information worker
productivity using a fully representative set of tasks, nor did we
attempt to run experiments in fully ecologically valid scenarios. We
are moving in these directions in ongoing research. Rather, for this
phase of research, we sought to explore whether Copilot provides
meaningful productivity boosts on some common tasks for which
we believed it was likely to do so based on the properties of the
technology. In other words, in the language of Dell'Acqua et al.
[10], we primarily explored tasks on the AI-friendly side of the
“jagged technological frontier.”
The dozens of researchers in Microsoft’s “AI and Productivity”
research team have launched over 30 studies looking at this first
question, as well as more advanced ones that will be the subject of
follow-up reports. While most of the studies remain active, a
sufficient number have returned results to justify a synthesis of the
research we have conducted to address this first question. This
report covers these initial findings. In future manuscripts, we plan
to report on research with substantially increased ecological
validity (e.g., via RCTs deployed in real organizations), added
diversity in methodology (e.g., via privacy-preserving analyses of
chat logs [24]), targeted studies of potential productivity barriers,
analyses of new and improved capabilities, and other means of
more holistically understanding the productivity impacts of LLMbased tools.
At a high level, the results thus far support the hypothesis that the
first versions of Microsoft’s Copilot tools do substantially increase
productivity on some common tasks performed by enterprise

Cambon et al. 2023
information workers. This productivity boost most often appears as
a meaningful increase in speed of execution without a significant
decrease in quality, although there is some variation how the
greater productivity manifests.
We also saw several other trends in the first wave of studies. For
instance, the willingness-to-pay for LLM-based tools is higher for
people who have used the tools, suggesting that the tools provide
value above initial expectations. We also see evidence of high selfreported productivity when using LLM-based tools, with perceived
time saved substantially exceeding actual time saved. Finally,
although not the focus of this phase of the research, we observed
early evidence that there are tasks for which the productivity gains
are more complex and may be harder to actualize in certain cases,
with current LLM-based tools providing a new set of options rather
than simply accelerating existing ways of working.
Below, we first provide a brief description of the studies whose
results are included in this first research report. We then present
cross-cutting findings of the studies, focusing on three dimensions
of productivity: speed, quality, and effort. Finally, we close with
Discussion and Future Work.

Study Descriptions

In this section we provide a brief overview of the studies included
in this first report. Many are or will be supported by separate
dedicated manuscripts, and we leave methodological detail to those
manuscripts, providing links where possible. While none of these
studies have yet gone through peer review, several are currently
under review with more to be submitted soon. Note also that in
addition to the eight studies presented here, the AI and Productivity
research team has many others in progress. These will be discussed
in future reports as their findings develop. When we discuss results
of the studies that involve comparisons (e.g. between a treatment
and control), we only report results that were determined to be
significant by a traditional statistical test (unless otherwise noted).
Copilot Common Task Study: This experiment assessed
productivity gains from Copilot across multiple tasks common
among office workers: email information retrieval, intranet
(SharePoint) information retrieval, content creation, and meeting
summarization. We recruited 147 participants via the Upwork
platform. We randomly divided participants into treatment
(Copilot) and control (no Copilot) groups. To assess the quality of
participants’ information retrieval, we asked them questions about
the information they found, and we scored their accuracy. To assess
the quality of the content they drafted, we asked a LLM both to
check for key facts and to assess quality along multiple dimensions.
To assess speed, we measured the time taken for each subtask and
for the series of tasks as a whole. In a post-task survey, we also
asked participants how they felt about the task and the products they
used. Details are in the full manuscript [13].
Primary study authors: Benjamin Edelman, Donald Ngwe
Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey: Microsoft first launched
Copilot to the public via an “Early Access Program.” Only a small

number of people in each organization invited to join the program
had access to Copilot. We surveyed these early adopters to
understand their experiences and perceived productivity gains
using Copilot. We excluded responses from anyone who said they
had been using Copilot for less than three weeks, with a final
sample consisting of 297 responses. The survey was 10 minutes in
length and was deployed globally from October 3 to November 2,
2023, with a cross-functional representation in its sample. The
survey was fully anonymous.

Bermejo-Cano, Eric Knudsen
Copilot in Teams Meeting Study: This study sought to test
productivity effects of Copilot for catching up on missed meetings.
We recruited 57 Microsoft employees for the study. Access to
Copilot was deployed across Microsoft largely on a division-bydivision basis, with certain divisions gaining access before others.
Thirty-three of the participants in the study had access to Copilot,
while the rest did not. We provided participants with a recording
and transcript of a scripted 35-minute Teams meeting between four
employees planning a fictional team offsite. We then asked
participants to write a 200- to 300-word email summarizing details
from the “missed” meeting. Participants completed the study
unmoderated and online. They recorded their computer screens
after providing consent. To assess speed, we used time on the task.
To measure quality, two independent (human) raters scored email
contents for key details from the meeting. After the task was
complete, we asked participants how productive they felt and how
draining they perceived the task to be, among other questions.

Cambon
Copilot Information Retrieval Study: This experiment examined
productivity gains in enterprise information retrieval. We recruited
163 participants via Upwork, randomly split them into treatment
(Copilot) and control (no Copilot) groups, and we brought them
into a simulated enterprise environment. The environment included
an organizational procurement policy customized from a publicdomain government procurement policy, as well as a large number
of files that were irrelevant to the task. We also prepopulated users’
email inboxes and calendars with a variety of messages and
meetings. We asked participants to answer questions about
information in the files, emails, and meeting invites. We scored
their work for accuracy, and we measured the time required for
completion. In a post-task survey, we also asked participants how
they felt about the task and the products they used. Details are in
the full manuscript [13].
Primary study authors: Ben Edelman, Donald Ngwe, Sida Peng
LLM-based Search Study: This early-stage study used an LLMbased search tool based on GPT-3.5 and compared the tool with
traditional search for complex information retrieval tasks.
Participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We ran
two experiments: one that examined speed and accuracy of the task
(90 participants) and another focused on the effectiveness of a

simple intervention for when the LLM produced incorrect results
(120 participants). Details are in the full manuscript [25].
Primary study authors: Jake Hofman, Sofia Spatharioti, David
Rothschild, Dan Goldstein
Outlook Email Study: In this study, we assessed the quality of
emails written using Copilot in Outlook versus ordinary emails
written without Copilot. We recruited 62 participants from
Upwork, all native speakers of US English. For a corpus of actual
emails among business professionals and executives, we selected
authors and messages from the Enron email corpus, a common
dataset for e-mail research [9,20]. For each original email we
selected, we then used the Outlook “Sound Like Me” feature to
create a variant rewritten by Copilot in the style of the underlying
author. We repeated this process for numerous emails from
numerous authors. We then showed the human-written and
Copilot-written messages to participants in various arrangements
and combinations, and we asked them to evaluate both the humanand AI-written emails on factors such as clarity, conciseness, and
the degree to which an email “sounded like” the original author.
Details are in the full manuscript [12].

M365 Defender Security Copilot Study: This experiment studied
productivity gains in enterprise security operations. We recruited
149 participants from Upwork, security novices with standard IT
skills but no specific security expertise. We gave them all access to
M365 Defender, and we randomly granted half of them access to
Security Copilot, which provides AI-based interpretation of
security incidents, recommends responses, and interprets attack
scripts. We asked participants to explore the tool, then answer
questions about what they found. Details are in the full manuscript
[11].
Primary study authors: Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng
GitHub Copilot Study: The first study in the research program
whose results have already been widely disseminated, this study
recruited 95 developers from Upwork to implement an HTTP
server in JavaScript and gave half of them access to GitHub
Copilot. Participants were incentivized to complete the task
quickly. The task was considered complete when a participant’s
code passed twelve programmed tests. Researchers measured both
the completion rate and average time to completion for participants
with and without Copilot. Details are in the full manuscript [23].

Findings

Defining productivity
Choosing a definition of productivity that is relevant to a wide
variety of information worker contexts is notoriously difficult
[16,21]. For this work, we opted to use a three-part framework that

Microsoft Technical Report
aims to capture both short- and long-term productivity effects that
could result from the introduction of LLM-based tools for
information workers. The three parts of this framework are (1)
speed, (2) quality, and (3) effort.
The first two metrics are motivated by the basic economic
understanding of productivity as output for a given input. We track
how quickly participants finish a task, the output per unit time
(speed). Since the lab studies asked participants to do a fixed set
(quantity) of tasks, we look at the quality of their work as a measure
of output. The definition of quality varies from study to study, but
accuracy on the task in question is the most common.
Our centering of effort as a core metric is less traditional, but aims
to capture well-known long-term productivity effects that can result
from changes to working practices, often enabled by increased
automation. In particular, scholars of Taylorism and related
production strategies have often noted that boosts to productivity
through new working practices are sometimes offset in the longterm by increases in turnover, growing worker dissatisfaction, and
related effects [3,5]. Relatedly, there is some evidence that broadbased job satisfaction is currently quite low (e.g. [17]); as such, it
is also possible that LLM-based technologies might actually help
mitigate these types of issues, e.g. by reducing effort on tasks
perceived as draining. The studies in this paper that track effort
operationalize it differently, and usually do so through surveybased approaches that seek to understand the degree of exhaustion
experienced or perceived energy expended by a participant. Future
studies will seek to evaluate effort using other techniques, including
functional neuroimaging.
Speed
For almost all of the tasks across all of the studies, we observed a
significant increase in the speed of performing tasks when using an
LLM-based tool relative to performing the tasks without the tool.
Figure 1 summarizes these observed speed increases. Copilot users
completed the task in 26% to 73% of the time, on average, when
compared with people not using Copilot, with the largest difference
being in the Copilot in Teams Meeting Study. Of course, the overall
current speed increase from using Copilot is likely to be much
lower than this, given the tasks studied were ones we believed were
particularly likely to benefit from AI support.
Our surveys showed that participants also perceived substantial
time savings. In the Copilot Common Tasks Study, we asked
participants with Copilot to estimate how much time that tool saved
them. They guessed 36 minutes on average, when actual time
savings were 12 minutes on average, indicating their perception of
significant time reduction on the tasks. Similarly, 73% of
employees surveyed in the Early Access Program research agreed
that Copilot helped them complete tasks faster, and 85% said it
would help them get to a good first draft faster. When asked to
estimate how much time Copilot saved them on a daily basis,
respondents most often reported 11-30 minutes (35%) and another
22% reported greater than that. Average daily time saved was 14
minutes a day, or 1.2 hours a week when calculated using the lower

Cambon et al. 2023
end of the time range bins (“0 minutes”, “<5 minutes”, “5-10
minutes”, “11-30 minutes”, “31-60 minutes”, and “>1 hour”).
Quality
Looking across the set of studies, there was a strong trend for the
increases in speed to come without costs to quality – participants
using LLM-based tools achieved quality levels that were not
statistically distinguishable from those who were not using LLMbased tools. For example, in both the Copilot Common Task Study
and the Copilot Information Retrieval Study, we did not see a
statistically significant effect on task accuracy, despite the
substantial increases in speed discussed above. Relatedly, the
Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey found that self-reported
quality assessments were also good: 68% agreed that Copilot
actually improved quality of their work.
We did observe a few exceptions to the general trend of “free”
increases in speed without costs to quality. In the Copilot in Teams
Meetings Study, there was a slight decrease in summarization
comprehensiveness relative to the comparison group. While
Copilot users took much less time, their summaries on average
included 11.06 out of 15 specific pieces of information in the
assessment rubric versus the 12.40 of 15 for users who did not have
access to Copilot.
The Outlook Email Study offered mixed evidence with respect to
quality. Emails written with Copilot were rated 18% clearer and
19% more concise. Participants also scored emails written with
Copilot 25% higher on, “Couldn’t have said it better myself.”
However, in some framings, subjects rated messages by Copilot as
less likely to be written by a human. That said, in other framings,
subjects were worse than random at identifying the human-written
messages. We see this as mixed evidence for the quality of Copilot
text. Copilot users appeared to like many aspects of the text it
generated, but could sometimes tell the difference between Copilot
writing versus human writing.
We also saw lower quality in one of the tasks in the LLM-based
Search Study [25] that was designed to be particularly complex so
the LLM would get the answer wrong. We found that the LLM’s
accuracy substantially impacted participants’ performance: when
the LLM got the answer right, there was no significant difference
between the treatment (LLM-based search) and the control group
(LLM-based search), but when the LLM got the answer wrong
accuracy dropped to under 50% in the treatment group. The study
also identified that straightforward UX-based uncertainty
visualizations can help address this issue. In particular, a simple
color-coded highlighting scheme, similar to spelling or grammar
check, was found to be effective for helping people identify
potentially unreliable information in LLM responses.
The search question the AI got wrong is an example of a task on
the other side of the “technological frontier” [10], unlike most of
the tasks considered in this report for which we hypothesized the
early version of these tools presented strong aptitude for AI
assistance. Future work that examines a broader set of tasks and
more representative work environments will likely involve more

productivity tool. The black bars indicate the percentage of

access.
exploration on the other side of this frontier, as well as of course
research into solutions that will move the frontier.
Finally, in the M365 Defender Security Copilot Study we saw a
significant and substantial increase in quality, although that was
almost certainly in part a product of the participant pool being made
up of security novices. Security novices with Copilot were 44%
more accurate in answering questions about the security incidents
they examined. We also asked subjects to write an essay about a
security incident, and those with Copilot included 151% more key
facts (based on the experts’ assessment rubric) and scored 32%
higher on summary quality, both as graded by LLM. Future work
should seek to assess related effects for those with security
experience.
Effort
When we were able to measure effort, we did not see any major
warning signs regarding long-term productivity impact (e.g., burnout, exhaustion, or reduction in motivation). In fact, we typically
saw the opposite. For instance, in the Copilot in Teams Meeting
Study, participants with access to Copilot found the task to be 58%

Early LLM-based Tools for Enterprise Information Workers
Likely Provide Meaningful Boosts to Productivity
less draining than participants without access. In the M365
Defender Security Copilot Study, subjects with Copilot reported
16% lower agreement with the statement “This task was a lot of
effort” (compared to control users doing the same task without
Copilot), and Copilot users reported 83% agreement with the
statement “Copilot reduced my effort on this task.” Similarly, in the
Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey, Copilot users overall
agreed that Copilot helped them spend less mental effort on
mundane or repetitive tasks (72%).
The one exception to this trend related not to the capabilities of the
AI, but rather challenges with using pre-release software. For
instance, in the Copilot Common Task Study, technical disruptions
hindered some AI functions, and participants who experienced this
problem reported notably lower scores on metrics associated with
effort.
Perceived value
As noted earlier, this report should not be read as an assessment of
overall productivity gains on a representative set of tasks in wide
variety of ecologically valid work environments. Rather, in this
wave of work, we sought to test whether we saw productivity
boosts for some common tasks that enterprise information workers
perform. However, the Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey
provides a preview of what we might expect when we examine
Copilot in more ecologically valid conditions. The survey indicated
that the majority (70%) of respondents believed that Copilot
increased their productivity. Given that the tools were only
available to survey respondents in pre-release form, these results
suggest more general productivity benefits as we broaden our
research scope, even if these initial results are likely skewed by
some novelty effects [14].
We also saw evidence for how users valued the tool in what they
were willing to give up for it. In the Copilot Usage in the Workplace
Survey, 77% of respondents said they would choose Copilot over a
weekly free lunch worth $40 / month. In the lab studies, people had
exposure to Copilot for only the one study, but were still willing to
pay more for it than those who had not used it. In the Copilot
Common Task Study, the reported willingness-to-pay for Copilot
was 35% greater than for those who had used Copilot in the study
versus those who received only a description of the tool. Similarly,
those in the treatment group of the Copilot Information Retrieval
Study were 40% more likely to say they would pay >$20 USD for
the tool relative to those in the control group.

Discussion and Future Work

With any new “general purpose technology” like LLMs [15],
research shows that it often takes both time and complementary
innovations to realize significant productivity gains [8]. The results
in this paper suggest we are already moving steadily along this
journey. That said, it is clear that there is much more to do.
Perhaps most notably, nearly all research seeking to measure
potential productivity gains from LLMs (including the research in

Microsoft Technical Report
this paper) has focused on task-level productivity, but the literature
suggests one of the most critical complementary innovations that
will be needed maximize productivity gains will be entirely
reinvented workflows with new and rearranged tasks [8]. Tools that
are chat-centered (vs. app-centered) and agent-like technologies
may mark the beginning of these new workflows, but future
research is needed to assess whether that can and will bear out.
Different productivity measurement strategies will likely also be
needed if people are bypassing existing tasks and doing new ones
instead, rather than simply doing existing tasks faster or better.
It is also important to note that the tools studied in this paper – and
the underlying language models – are under active development.
As such, the results in this paper should be viewed as capturing a
moment in time versus providing evidence for strong claims about
LLM-based productivity tools in a long-term persistent steady
state. This is a key reason we put the word “early” in the title of this
paper. Running the same studies on the same tools in a year may
yield different results. Similarly, user expectations are changing
quickly as well, with any novelty effects likely moderating
relatively quickly. This paper must also be viewed with awareness
of the conflicts of interest involved: the authors are Microsoft
researchers studying Microsoft products. While the studies were
done using standard scientific practices and many are being
submitted for peer review, it is useful to make these conflicts
explicit.
Another limitation of the research presented is that it was all done
with English speakers doing tasks in English. It is likely that for
some languages, especially low-resource ones, the observed
productivity gains will be less due to a decrease in quality of the
tools’ output. Researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere are working
to improve the “hyperlingual” [19] capabilities of LLMs and LLMbased productivity tools, e.g. in non-English and low-resource
languages [1,2].
Though the early findings above suggest LLM-based productivity
tools largely provide a “free” speed increase without decreasing
quality, we also saw some evidence that for certain tasks, LLMs
will likely pose a tradeoff. In doing so, LLM-based productivity
tools may sometimes provide a new option for information workers
that did not exist before: the ability to do a certain set of tasks far
faster but with marginally lower quality, potentially freeing up time
for other activities. We plan to explore this other side of the
“frontier” [10] in upcoming work.
More generally, there have been a number of major disruptions to
work practices in recent years: not just LLMs, but also remote work
and hybrid work. One way to view the impact of all these changes
is through the lens of the new dimensions of choice they have
created for workers. Remote work created new opportunities for
where work can be done (what space is used), each with its own
pros and cons. Improved tools for asynchronous collaboration (like
the ability to record meetings) allow people more options for when
work can be done (what time it gets done). And current LLMs now
create new possibilities for the way that work is accomplished

Cambon et al. 2023
(what intelligence is brought to the fore). Five years ago, for
example, most content creation in the enterprise was done in an
office between 9am and 5pm, with a human writing every word.
Now there are many additional ways to do that work, each with its
relative strengths and weaknesses. While the expanded choices
bring new uncertainty and risks, they also create substantial new
opportunities for making work overall far better than it was before.
