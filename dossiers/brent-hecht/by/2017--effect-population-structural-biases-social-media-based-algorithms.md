ABSTRACT

Much research has shown that social media platforms have
substantial population biases. However, very little is known
about how these population biases affect the many
algorithms that rely on social media data. Focusing on the
case study of geolocation inference algorithms and their
performance across the urban-rural spectrum, we establish
that these algorithms exhibit significantly worse
performance for underrepresented populations (i.e. rural
users). We further establish that this finding is robust across
both text- and network-based algorithm designs. However,
we also show that some of this bias can be attributed to the
design of algorithms themselves rather than population
biases in the underlying data sources. For instance, in some
cases, algorithms perform badly for rural users even when
we substantially overcorrect for population biases by training
exclusively on rural data. We discuss the implications of our
findings for the design and study of social media-based
algorithms.

research that takes advantage of this publicly-available, realtime stream of information has also become quite prevalent.
In addition to facilitating new discoveries about human
behavior in the social sciences and related fields (e.g.,

development of new intelligent algorithms. For instance,
researchers have used social media to develop new
recommender systems (e.g., [38,59]), summarize the
character of cities (e.g., [9,66]), and infer the location of
Internet users (e.g., [34,41,45]), among other applications
(e.g., [4,30,49]).
Recently, concerns about population bias in social media
have been the subject of much discussion (most notably in
Science [55]). Social media population bias, or the notion
that different demographic groups may participate in social
media platforms at different rates, has been found to be
endemic to most social media datasets. Much work has gone
into quantifying and understanding these biases, with
significant biases being found along gender (e.g., [51]), age
(e.g., [39]), race (e.g., [46]), income (e.g., [44]), education
(e.g., [39]), and urban/rural lines (e.g., [28]).
Many researchers who use social media to understand human
behavior have recognized the importance of correcting for
social media population biases in their studies (e.g., [14,55]).
They have also begun the critical work of developing best
practices for doing so (e.g., [55]). However, the same is not
true in literature on social media-based algorithms: even
though it has been hypothesized for several years that
population bias would affect social media-based algorithms
(e.g., [28,46]), little research has been done to investigate this
hypothesis (let alone identify remediating measures).
The goal of this paper is to help address this gap in the
literature. Since the space of social media-based algorithms
and social media population biases is extensive, we initiated
our exploration with a focused but important case study:
examining the performance of Twitter geolocation inference
algorithms across the U.S. urban-rural spectrum. Due to the
rising import of geographic information, geolocation
inference algorithms – usually focusing on Twitter data –
have attracted widespread interest across computer science
and related fields (e.g., [10,15,23,25,33,45,52]). The aim of
these algorithms is to predict the location of a Twitter user or
her tweets using implicit signals. This is typically done by
examining the content of the user’s tweets and/or the
geographic configuration of her explicitly encoded social
ties.

Similarly, U.S. rural-urban biases in social media have also
attracted a growing amount of attention in the literature (e.g.,
[22,28,31,67]). This is likely in part due to the relatively
large effect sizes involved: people who live in rural areas
often participate in social media at a fraction of the rate of
their urban counterparts and contribute orders of magnitude
less content. Twitter is no exception to this trend (e.g.,
[31,61,67]). The urban-rural population-bias effect sizes are
of particular interest given the significant size of the rural
population: over 46 million people live in rural counties in
the United States (close to double the population of 18-24
year-olds) [36].
Rather than focusing on a single geolocation algorithm to
assess the effect of urban/rural population bias on algorithm
effectiveness, we study two well-known geolocation
inference algorithms: that of Priedhorsky et al. [52] and that
of Jurgens [33]. We chose these two algorithms because they
span the range geolocation inference algorithm design,
allowing us to more robustly evaluate the effect of
population bias. Priedhorsky et al.’s and Jurgens’ algorithms
fundamentally differ in two key ways: methodological
paradigm and problem definition. With respect to paradigm,
Priedhorsky et al.’s algorithm is representative of text-based
approaches
to
geolocation
inference
(e.g.,
[6,27,37,43,52,53]) while Jurgens’ is representative of
network-based approaches (e.g., [3,10,33,45,54]). Similarly,
Priedhorsky et al.’s algorithm seeks to solve the “geolocate
a tweet” version of the problem, while Jurgens’ algorithm
addresses the “geolocate a user” version of the problem.
As we will describe below, we find that regardless of
methodological paradigm or problem definition, geolocation
algorithms underperform for rural users. In some cases, the
effect sizes are dramatic. For instance, the text-based
algorithm is able to geolocate urban tweets within 100km of
their true location at a rate 2.3x greater than is the case for
rural tweets.
However, a major result in this paper is that population bias
is not the only driver of population-variable accuracy in
social media-based algorithms. Rather, we find evidence that
design choices in social media-based algorithms can also
have a powerful biasing effect. That is, our results suggest
that algorithmic bias is a function to a large degree of both
population bias in the underlying social media dataset and
structural bias that arises from algorithmic design choices.
We also observe early evidence that text-based algorithms
may be more liable to structural bias than network-based
algorithms. In particular, we found that when population bias
was removed through balanced resampling and
oversampling, our network-based algorithm showed much
improved performance on rural users, but the same methods
were less effective in our text-based algorithm.
This paper has several implications for those who develop
and study social media-based algorithms. For instance, our
research provides additional weight to calls (e.g., [57]) to
consider the design of algorithms rather than just the output

of these algorithms when evaluating intelligent technologies
for bias. In other words, our results directly motivate further
research on algorithmic design decisions that avoid structural
bias. Moreover, as we will discuss, our results point to
specific solutions to structural bias in the geographic
algorithm domain. Similarly, our results also highlight the
dangers of global evaluation metrics for social media-based
algorithms, providing a data point that shows that these
metrics can hide poor performance for certain populations
and establish perverse incentives to reduce performance for
these populations even further when they are minorities.
In addition to showing that both population and structural
bias can result in uneven performance by social media
algorithms, this research also makes more specific
contributions to the large body of research on geolocation
inference algorithms. Namely, by demonstrating that these
algorithms’ performance is geographically variable in a
systemic fashion, we show that it is likely that these
algorithms have introduced additional bias into the studies
and systems that have used their output. This raises the stakes
for quickly identifying solutions and establishing best
practices. It also suggests that researchers who use these
algorithms should be careful to audit their output as we have
done here prior to incorporating them into their larger
systems.
Finally, it is important to note before continuing that while
we find important biases that are robust across two separate
algorithms, this is a case study on Twitter geolocation
inference rather than an exhaustive survey of population
bias’s effect on all social media-based algorithms. Given
their import, identifying potential biases in social mediabased algorithms is a serious matter, as is developing means
of addressing them. However, because our findings our
limited to a single algorithm family (albeit an important one),
our findings should be interpreted as an important
preliminary step in these directions rather than the definitive
answer to the associated questions.
RELATED WORK

This work builds on research in three main areas: 1)
characterization of population bias in social media, 2) social
media-based geolocation algorithms, and 3) the literature on
algorithmic accountability. We discuss these areas and their
relationship to our work below.
Population Bias in Social Media

Population bias is a well-studied issue in social media. Since
2005, the Pew Research Center has conducted annual
surveys of social media usage in the United States. These
surveys [51] show that social media participation rates vary
extensively across gender, race, education, socioeconomic
status, and urban-rural lines.
Augmenting the Pew findings, many researchers have
investigated this problem by analyzing the geographic
distribution of posts across social media sites and making
demographic inferences from census data or from users’ self-

reported information. The demographic dimension of
analysis we choose for our study – the urban-rural spectrum
– has been the focus of some of this work. For instance,
Hecht and Stephens [28] studied Foursquare, Flickr, and
Twitter and found a consistent pro-urban bias (e.g., there are
3.5 times more Twitter users per capita in urban areas than
rural areas). Similarly, Malik et al. [44] demonstrated that
there are higher densities of tweets in urban, young, and rich
areas. Gilbert, Karahalios, and Sandvig [21] found
substantial differences in behavior between urban and rural
users in Myspace. Many other papers have studied
population bias issues across other geographies, platforms,
and demographics, and, to our best knowledge, some form of
population bias has consistently appeared in all of this work.
A few researchers have attempted to explicitly account for
population bias in their own studies. Culotta [14]
demonstrated that tweet-based models of public health
indicators saw improved performance when their Twitter
dataset was balanced for race and gender by county.
Landeiro and Culotta [37] examined how to control for shifts
in the magnitude of population bias within input data to
classification algorithms. Finally, Pavalanathan and
Eisenstein [50] have explored how people of different ages
and genders tweet differently and how this relates to
performance in geolinguistic algorithms. They balanced their
tweet samples based on the total population by county but
did not find that this significantly impacted their algorithm.
We are motivated by the above work and the questions that
it raises. While Culotta saw improved precision when
controlling for specific population biases, Pavalanathan and
Eisenstein did not when controlling for more general
population density, but still found vast disparities in
performance of the algorithm across age and gender. These
divergent results raise the question of how algorithmic bias
arises and is manifest in social media-based algorithms as
well as the relationship between algorithmic bias and
population bias in social media. Our results explain the
conflicting findings in this motivating work by delineating
the concept of structural bias and showing how it can
counteract or exacerbate population bias. Moreover, by also
examining network-based algorithms in our research, we are
able to speak more broadly to social media-based algorithms
in general and not just a single class of algorithms.
Geolocation Inference Algorithms

A large portion of the research and applications associated
with Twitter data has a geographic component. However,
this research is limited by the fact that only 1-2% of tweets
are geolocated [10]. As a result, geolocation inference
algorithms for Twitter, which attempt to uncover tweet and
user locations that have not been explicitly disclosed, have
become a very common direction of study [18]. Similar
algorithms have been developed for other social media
platforms as well (e.g., Flickr [19] and Tumblr [11])
There are two main classes of Twitter geolocation inference
algorithms [34]: text-based, which predict the location of a

tweet based on its content, and network-based, which predict
a home location for a user based on their connections to other
users.
Text-based geolocation algorithms rely on the tendency for
language usage to vary as a function of geography (e.g.,
[65]). By extracting lexical features and concepts local to an
area from the text during a training phase (e.g., sports teams,
regional vernacular, a town name), these algorithms can
build models that predict the geographic location of a new
tweet based on its content. These algorithms generally either
attempt to model text features as an explicitly spatial process
(e.g., [52,53,64]) or treat the geolocation problem as a
classification problem among administrative units (e.g.,
cities) (e.g., [8,25,43]).
Network-based geolocation algorithms rely on the social
network in which social media posts are typically embedded.
In these algorithms, explicitly encoded network ties or user
interactions are used to build an egocentric social network
for the user whose location is desired. Any known locations
of the user’s neighbors are combined to predict the location
of the user [34]. This approach leverages a fundamental
principle in human geography that, in general, interaction
decreases with distance (e.g., [24]), meaning that connected
users are likely close geographically [3].
Though our goal is to probe algorithmic bias within social
media-based algorithms in general, selecting geolocation
algorithms as our case study has two additional benefits: both
text-based (e.g., [6,27,37,43,52,53]) and network-based
(e.g., [3,10,33,45,54]) geolocation inference have been a
major area of interest in the past few years, and our work can
help lead to more equal and effective approaches in the
future. Second, because of this robust literature on both textand network-based approaches, we are able to explore bias
in social-media based algorithms that draw on two of the
most prominent methodological paradigms, improving
generalizability
and
affording
cross-paradigmatic
comparisons.
Algorithmic Accountability

Our research builds on the growing literature on algorithmic
accountability (e.g., [2,56,57]), in which algorithms are
probed for discrimination or other societally undesirable
outcomes. Our work extends the accountability literature to
include well-known geolocation inference algorithms (and
the rural-urban divide). Additionally, much of the
algorithmic accountability literature has focused on detecting
algorithmic bias when faced with a black-box system (e.g.
[7,35,60,63]). Our research focuses on algorithms with a
published description, open-source code, and accessible
data, enabling us to investigate biases at a more detailed
level, determine the potential causes of these biases with
more certainty, and begin to learn how to mitigate these
biases. In the discussion section, we highlight how our
findings related to structural bias emphasize the importance
of lower-level analyses (as per Sandvig et al. [57]) and open-

source implementations in understanding and reducing
algorithmic bias.
METHODS AND DATA

In this section, we describe our two focus geolocation
inference algorithms and the datasets they use in more detail.
In general, our approach to working with these algorithms
was to replicate the choices and approach taken in the
corresponding papers. In the few cases when this was not
possible, we deferred to other best practices in the
geolocation literature as is explained below.
Text-based Algorithm

We selected the text-based algorithm from Priedhorsky et al.
[52] for our analysis. We chose this algorithm because it is
representative of many text-based algorithms in its general
approach (e.g., it calculates a geographic layer for each term
and utilizes a standard set of Twitter text and metadata
fields), has made an impact since it was published (e.g.,
[25]), and its source code has been made available by its
authors1, which minimizes the risk of implementation error
and provides us with full control over the algorithm and its
inputs.
The algorithm is trained on a set number of tweets with
known locations and builds Gaussian mixture models
(GMMs) for tokens in the text of the tweet, its user’s timezone, self-reported location field, and specified language.
The GMMs capture the probability that a given token
originated from an area based on the training data. A
prediction for a given tweet is made by tokenizing it,
weighting and combining the individual GMMs for each
token in the tweet, and making a prediction based on the
highest probability area in the resulting GMM.
Network-based Algorithm

We selected the algorithm by Jurgens [33] for our networkbased algorithm. We chose this algorithm because its
performance is in line with other state-of-the-art approaches
[34]. Additionally, like Priedhorsky et al.’s algorithm, code
for Jurgens’ algorithm has been provided by the author2,
minimizing implementation risk and allowing for direct
manipulation.
Jurgens’ algorithm builds a bi-directional mention network
by generating an edge between two users only when both
users have mentioned each other in a tweet. A mention
occurs when a user includes another user’s username in a
tweet using the “@” notation (e.g., “President
@barackobama will be speaking tonight”). Starting with a
training set of users with known locations, Jurgens’
algorithm iteratively propagates the location of the known
users to any of their neighbors who have not been
successfully located, inferring the location of a newly located

user in each iteration as the median of their previously
located neighbors. Jurgens repeats this process for five
iterations and we do the same in our analyses.
Social Media Datasets

We built our tweet dataset for our text-based algorithm
following standard practices in the text-based geolocation
inference community (e.g. [6,16,37]). More specifically, we
utilized the Twitter Streaming API with a bounding box
configured to the contiguous United States, which, like many
geographic studies of geotagged content in the U.S. (e.g.
[39,47])3, was the geographic extent of our analyses. In line
with prior work (e.g. [6,16,37]), we left open our tweet
collector for one month. Only tweets with coordinates in the
contiguous United States were retained, resulting in a dataset
of 51.2 million tweets from 1.6 million unique users from
October 2014. All of these tweets are explicitly geotagged
with the latitude-longitude coordinates from where the tweet
originated, which is necessary to provide ground truth of the
algorithm. One important exception to our approach relative
to that of Priedhorksy et al. was that we used geographically
bounded version of the Streaming API rather than the
random Streaming API. We made this exception for a simple
reason: we required a much larger dataset in our study region
in order to have sufficient data in rural areas for our
experiments.
Network-based approaches utilize different techniques to
collect data than text models and, as such, it was important
to collect a separate dataset to be in accordance with standard
practices in the network-based domain. To gather data for
our network model, we adopted the methodology used by
Jurgens et al. [34], which involved building a mention
network from a dataset of randomly collected tweets (our
dataset started with 99 million tweets from 26 million users
from August and September 2015). We further restricted this
dataset to only consider tweets from users we could
geolocate to the United States, which narrowed our dataset
down to 3.2 million tweets from 1.2 million users as
described below, of which 113K comprised the ground truth
of our final mention network (see below for more
information about ground truth development). Though this is
smaller than that used by Jurgens et al., it is in line with other
network-based algorithm studies [34].
Ground Truth Data

As noted above, we selected the urban-rural divide as our
focus demographic dimension because it corresponds to a
well-studied population bias that exists in most forms of
social media [28]. To categorize locations along the
urban/rural spectrum for our second demographic variable,
we follow standard practice in the literature that looks at
urban/rural issues in online communities [28,32].
3

Geographic methods often assume a contiguous region, and this
is the case for the methods we employ here. Moreover, given their
populations, it is highly unlikely that the inclusion of Alaska and
Hawaii would have significant altered our results.

Specifically, we utilize the U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics’ Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties
[29], which assigns each county in the United States an
ordinal code from 1 (most urban) to 6 (most rural).
Using these codes, it is straightforward to obtain urban/rural
data for our text-based algorithm’s ground-truth dataset.
Namely, since this dataset consists entirely of geotagged
tweets in the contiguous United States, we simply perform a
reverse geocoding operation that labels each tweet with the
county in which it is located. We then assign each county’s
urban/rural code to the tweet.
While text-based algorithms predict the location of each
tweet individually, as noted above, network-based
approaches typically seek to locate a given user (and assign
all of that user’s tweets to that “home” location). There are
two methods used in the literature for determining a user’s
home location for use as ground truth in these algorithms (see
Johnson et al. [31] for a complete overview of ground truth
identification techniques). Jurgens [33] and McGee,
Caverlee, and Cheng [45] respectively define a user’s home
location as the geometric median of their tweets given a
minimum of five (three) geotagged tweets within 30
kilometers (50 miles) of each other. The other method takes
advantage of the user’s self-reported location field. This
method has the drawback of being quite noisy [27] and
though Jurgens et al. [34] found the location field to lead to
lower overall precision, it is a method that has been used
routinely in the literature [40,54]
We first evaluated the geometric median method for our
dataset but found the resultant dataset to be prohibitively
small, with only 20,000 users and a miniscule number of
rural users. As such, we turned instead to geocoding the
location field through an approach that has been shown to
significant reduce the noise in this data source (albeit with
reduced recall) [26]: using a Wikipedia-based geocoder. We
leveraged the geocoder in WikiBrain [58], which resulted in
a much larger dataset of 1.2 million users from which we
built our mention network.
In line with previous results on population bias, we found
that, relative to our census data, the most urban users (NCHS
class 1) were highly overrepresented in our datasets (130%
and 210% relative to their proportion in the overall
population for the text-based and network-based datasets
respectively). The most rural users (NCHS class 6) were
accordingly underrepresented (45% and 24% relative
proportion for the text-based and network-based datasets
respectively). Lastly, it is important to note that rural/urban
labels were used for evaluation purposes only and are not
provided to the algorithm with training or testing data.
Evaluation Framework

When evaluating the two algorithms, we followed the
procedure outlined by the two corresponding papers as
closely as possible to measure the bias present in typical
performance. We use five-fold validation for each network-

based model. For the text model, we build and test five
models for each condition. We constrain the test tweets in
each text-based model to those from the days following the
dates of the tweets that comprise the training data, ensure no
overlap in users between training and testing phases, and use
training set sizes (30,000) equal to those used by Priedhorsky
et al. However, because we were limited to the Streaming
API rather than the higher-volume “gardenhose” API for
collecting our Twitter data, we limited the size of our
network model training datasets to 24,000 users (selected
anew for each fold out of the 113,000 who comprised our
ground truth data), which is smaller than that used by
Jurgens. We examined training datasets up to 40,000 for our
baseline model though and found similar trends.
In all cases, we define algorithm precision as the percentage
of predictions within 100km of the actual location. We tested
different values for the distance (20km, 50km, 200km,
500km) as well as defining a true positive as a prediction
lying within the same county as the ground truth (much
research aggregates tweets to counties in order to leverage
census data). All of these definitions led to similar patterns
of results. We also tested the text-based algorithm with a
similar dataset of tweets from June 2015 and saw similar
trends. We only report recall (the percentage of users or
tweets for which an algorithm could provide a location) for
the network-based models because the recall was
consistently around 100% for the text-based models.
In line with the NCHS classifications [29], we combine data
from counties with NCHS codes of 1 and 2 (“large
metropolitan counties”) into one “urban” class and counties
from NCHS codes of 5 and 6 (“nonmetropolitan counties”)
into one “rural” class. We use these definitions of urban and
rural for the rest of the paper. We restrict our reporting and
discussion to just these urban and rural classes, though the
results for NCHS categories 3 and 4 generally fell between
those for the urban and rural classes.
RESULTS

We structured our exploration of the effect of population bias
on social media-based algorithms by asking three cascading
research questions. Our first question was whether the two
geolocation algorithms exhibit biased performance in favor
of urban areas (RQ1: Is there an algorithmic bias in the
direction of the population bias?). Our next step was to
inquire whether any identified bias was due to population
bias (RQ2: Is any bias due to population bias?). We did
this by examining the change in algorithmic bias when we
adjusted the training dataset so that it contained a
representative urban/rural sample of the general population.
Finally, given a positive answer to RQ2, we planned a third
research question whose objective was to investigate
whether any remaining bias could be eliminated by training
solely on the algorithmically disadvantaged population
(RQ3: Can any remaining underperformance for a
specific population be fixed by training solely on data
from that population?). This is equivalent to building a

on the map” correctly. We return to this point in the
discussion section.

Below, we use our three research questions to structure our
discussion of our results. To determine the significance of
changes in precision of the algorithm, we adopt the methods
used by Compton et al. [10], which set confidence intervals
as the average precision ±1.5 times the interquartile range for
the folds. Comparisons are only made when confidence
intervals do not overlap unless otherwise noted.

The cells in the “Typical (Baseline)” rows and “% of
Training Data” column in Table 1 indicate that, as noted
above and in line with a number of previous studies on
Twitter, our unadjusted training data has significant
underlying population biases. For instance, we can see that
63.8% of our text-based urban/rural ground-truth dataset can
be classified as urban according to our definition, but only
9.0% of our dataset can be classified as rural. The actual
census proportions would be 55.3% and 15.0% respectively,
indicating a strong urban bias in our dataset.

RQ1: Is there algorithmic bias?

Examining the precision of each algorithm in urban and rural
contexts (Table 1, rows labeled “Typical (Baseline)”), a clear
pattern of bias emerges. Both algorithms perform worse for
rural users than for urban users, with the magnitude of the
bias being greatest in the text-based algorithm: this algorithm
is able to accurately locate urban users within 100km at a rate
approximately 2.3 times greater than that for rural users. The
equivalent precision number for the network model is 1.3x,
and recall is 1.6x better for urban users than rural users in the
network model as well.
Figure 1 on the following page shows the precision of the
text-based algorithm by county in the contiguous United
States. It demonstrates the depth of this bias – almost all high
precision clusters center in urban areas around cities.
In addition to motivating further inquiry as to whether this
algorithmic bias arises from population bias in the
underlying dataset or other factors (i.e. our RQ2 and RQ3),
this result has important implications in and of itself.
Namely, geolocation inference algorithms have served as
inputs to systems and studies and our results establish for the
first time that the use of these well-known geolocation
inference algorithms from the literature will inject further
population bias into any geographically referenced dataset of

RQ2: Is the observed bias due to population bias?

Our goal with this research question was to determine
whether correcting for this population bias in the training
datasets is the primary cause of the biases we observed in our
RQ1 analyses. As pointed out by Pavalanathan and
Eisenstein [50] and Burger et al. [5], more data about a group
in prediction tasks generally improves accuracy of the
algorithm. Therefore, we expect that by adjusting for
population bias, we can induce greater and perhaps equal
performance for underrepresented populations (i.e. rural
populations). Though rural areas still would have a much
lower number of tweets even within a population-balanced
dataset, maintaining a consistent number of tweets per
person in an area as training data should capture an equal
percentage of an area’s location-indicative words (to use
Han, Cook, and Baldwin's [25] vocabulary).
To answer our second research question, we performed a
simple modification of the datasets on which we trained each
algorithm: instead of resampling the datasets at random for
each fold of training the algorithm as we did in RQ1, we
resampled them such that they were representative of the
demographics of the general population with respect to the
rural/urban divide. In other words, we generated training

Figure 1. Text-based geolocation baseline precision by county (percentage of tweets originating from each county correctly
geolocated to within 100km of each tweet’s true location).

datasets without population bias. We did not adjust how we
sampled data for testing each fold (i.e. it remained random).
The results of the evaluation of each algorithm under this
population-balanced condition can be found in Table 1 in the
rows labeled “Population Bias Balanced”. These rows tell a
relatively straightforward story: while using a representative
sample of the general population significantly changed the
results for the network-based model with respect to the
urban/rural divide, balancing the population had only a
negligible effect on the text-based model. In other words, the
text-based model remained significantly urban-biased, even
when using a training set that removes population bias in the
underlying Twitter dataset. On the other hand, the networkbased model was significantly less biased when trained on a
population-balanced dataset.
Like was the case for RQ1, this result both motivates the
investigation of our subsequent research question (RQ3) and
has implications on its own. Whereas there is evidence that
addressing the effects of demographic bias in social mediabased social science research can be done by simply
resampling the underlying dataset [14], our findings suggest
the same cannot be said for social media-based algorithms,
at least in the case of our text-based model. This is another
subject to which we attend below.
RQ3: Can we fix biases through oversampling?

Even when the representation of rural Twitter users has been
boosted to match that of the general population, rural users
still make up a much smaller relative proportion of the
training set and therefore have a much smaller corresponding

absolute number of training samples. In this experiment, we
sought to see if this imbalance in absolute number of tweets
can explain the algorithmic bias we observed above.
We did this by training and testing on each demographic
group separately (i.e. separate models for rural and for
urban). If separate models perform equally well (e.g., rural
precision is as high as urban precision), then we would know
that the algorithmic bias in our algorithm arises solely from
population characteristics of the input dataset. If bias still
exists even in separate models, then we would know that
there are structural biases within the algorithms that prevent
equal performance for these demographics, no matter their
representation in the training dataset.
The results of this experiment can be seen in the rows labeled
“Urban Boosted” and “Rural Boosted” in Tables 1. Of
particular note is the performance of the text-based
algorithm. Even when training and testing solely on tweets
from rural users, the text-based model cannot geolocate these
tweets as well as it can for tweets from urban users when
using a simple random sample or population-adjusted
training set (let alone using an only-urban model). While we
do see a large and significant improvement in the rural case,
performance still falls short of that of urban tweets for all of
our models that contained any urban training data at all. We
also note that we tried boosting the absolute number of
training samples by up to two times the number used in
Priedhorsky et al., and the results were consistent: the ruralonly model still had a precision less than the random and
population-adjusted urban precision. In other words, no

matter the training data, there appears to be something in the
design of the text-based algorithm that prevents it from
performing well for rural users relative to urban users.
The story for the network-based model is different, with it
appearing to also suffer from structural biases, but not to the
same degree as the text-based model. With respect to
precision, the model trained only on rural users actually
outperforms the model trained only on urban users.
However, the recall remains lower than any of the urban
models.
These results have important implications for the design and
application of social media-based algorithms. We begin our
Discussion section below by highlighting these implications.
DISCUSSION
Algorithmic Bias = Population Bias + Structural Bias + Ɛ

The results to our second and third research questions
suggest a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms behind
algorithmic bias. Namely, while we saw that some
algorithmic bias could be explained by population bias in the
underlying training sets (e.g., the gap in performance
between urban and rural users in the network-based
algorithm), not all of it could. In fact, in the case of the textbased algorithm, even dramatically overcorrecting for
population bias by training solely on rural users did not make
the algorithm perform as well as it typically does for urban
users.
These findings support the notion that algorithmic bias must
be understood as a function of both population bias and
structural bias inherent to the algorithm’s design (as well as
other factors that have yet to be discovered). In other words,
there is something about the nature of some algorithms that
inherently biases them towards lower performance for
certain populations.
A Closer Look at Structural Bias

Examining the structure of the two algorithm families under
consideration, a number of hypotheses emerge for their
differing amounts of structural bias along urban/rural lines.
Network-based algorithms build an egocentric network, so a
prediction for a given user is affected directly by her/his
social network neighbors and potentially indirectly by other
nearby users (e.g. neighbors of neighbors) through multiple
stages of inference. This means that addition or subtraction
of users in one part of the network largely does not impact a
given user elsewhere in the network even though it can boost
precision and recall amongst their more immediate social
network neighbors. Indeed, within our mention network, we
find very high homophily: 90% of edges between users with
known ground-truth locations are of the same type (i.e. for a
user known to be in an rural class 6 county, there is a 90%
chance that any of their social network neighbors whose
location is known a priori are also in rural class 6 counties)
Boosting data for rural users therefore greatly increases the
likelihood that a rural user in the testing dataset will have
neighbors that are located without affecting most urban users

because they would not be closely linked through the
network to the rural users.
Text-based algorithms, on the other hand, see much greater
dependencies between users. Toponyms and language that
have broad usage across the country will be skewed towards
being located in urban areas with their higher density of
users. Furthermore, when examining the average number of
words per tweet that can be identified as geographic
Wikipedia concepts (i.e., words tied directly to place)
through wikification algorithms implemented by Sen et al.
[58], we see that the most urban tweets (NCHS code = “1”)
have 25% more “wikifiable” words per tweet than the most
rural tweets (NCHS code = “6”). Since location-specific
words such as these are key to how the text-based algorithm
operates, some of the urban advantage may come from
differing language patterns and topics of conversation in
tweets across urban-rural lines [16].
Another common design decision in text-based algorithms
that could be a cause of structural urban/rural bias relates to
the fixed distance parameters central to many of these
algorithms’ low-level functionality. These distance
parameters, which manifest as grid-cell sizes or geographic
probability distribution ranges, fail to take into account the
varying distances at which the use of a term is predictive in
urban versus rural areas. For instance, when someone tweets
a name of a high school mascot in an urban area, that name
is predictive for a smaller area than the same situation in a
rural area (i.e. rural areas have significantly larger school
districts by area). This problem can be understood in
geostatistics terms: the use of a fixed-distance parameter
assumes a fixed range of spatial autocorrelation for tweet
usage, which likely is not true across urban/rural lines. In
more general terms, this means that employing fixed distance
parameters will fail to capture the full predictive power of
each rural tweet in text-based algorithms, and rural areas
already have fewer tweets per capita to begin with.
Achieving Parity

Though lower overall recall and precision is a barrier to
implementation of network-based algorithms, our work
indicates that it may be easier to achieve parity within
network-based algorithms by boosting data collection efforts
around underrepresented populations. Although more work
should be done to confirm this effect in other types of social
media algorithms, researchers and designers for whom
equity is a top priority may want to consider utilizing
network-based methods when doing Twitter-based
geolocation.
It is also important to note that the contribution of structural
bias to algorithmic bias we have identified here adds weight
to the argument of Sandvig et al. [57] and others (e.g., [62])
that algorithmic accountability work needs to consider
algorithms at levels deeper than simply inputs and outputs
and that algorithmic accountability research teams have
people with “algorithmic skills that allow a facility with the

relevant [algorithmic] ideas” [57]. These skills will be
necessary to identify and address bias at the structural level.
Similarly, the notion of structural bias highlights the
importance of open-source implementations of algorithms.
Open-source affords the ability to understand and design
fixes for these algorithmic biases because we are able to
examine and manipulate how these algorithms function. Our
results show that we cannot rely solely on adjusting the data
going into the algorithm to achieve parity.
A Tradeoff Between Equity and Effectiveness

There is one column in Table 1 that we have yet to discuss in
detail: the “Overall” column. This column indicates the
performance on the entire randomized population (i.e. data
in an unmodified proportion of users and tweets). In other
words, the “Overall” column reports the precision (and
recall) a researcher or developer would expect to achieve if
she were to apply the model listed in each row to all of
Twitter.
There is a clear trend in the “Overall” column: for models in
which rural performance is better, the performance on
overall population gets worse. From the perspective of a
researcher or developer, this means that in order to improve
rural accuracy, one has to reduce overall accuracy.
Furthermore, for the text-based algorithm, we also tested a
wider variety of urban-rural training data proportions to
understand the responsiveness of the algorithm to smaller
shifts in data. In doing so, we found that peak performance
(21.0% overall precision at 100 km) came in a model that
removed a quarter of the rural training data and boosted
urban accordingly. Rural users performed very poorly in this
model (6.8% precision), but the slight increase in precision
for urban users (23.5% precision) along with their inherently
higher proportions in the testing data was sufficient to boost
the overall precision.
Our results demonstrate that, at least in the case of Twitter
geolocation, that there is a clear trade-off between equity and
effectiveness, a result for which there is evidence in other
algorithmic accountability contexts as well (e.g., [35,48]).
An important corollary to this tradeoff is that using single
measures of precision and recall for an algorithm can gloss
over very real, non-random variation in algorithmic
performance for different groups of people. Until better
algorithms can be developed that do not compromise equity
(or equality) for effectiveness (e.g., by addressing structural
bias), algorithm designers should conduct and report a more
thorough examination of performance across different
populations as has been advocated by many in the
algorithmic accountability community, especially when past
work has suggested that there may be population bias or
structural bias.
Privacy

We have conducted this research with the assumption that
higher precision and recall is a desirable outcome for a given
population. While this is a valid assumption in an application

of geolocation like public health tracking, this is not always
the case for social media-based algorithms and for
geolocation specifically. It is important to note that in this
light, there may be benefits to being “disadvantaged” by
geolocation algorithms: our results suggest that rural users
are harder to “find” in an automated fashion, preserving
privacy. Geolocation inference is already employed by at
least some social surveillance firms, locating tweets based on
the language and metadata [17]. An interesting direction of
research (e.g. [25]) is to invert the goals of this paper and
attempt to find ways reduce the “geolocatability” of a person
or a population (i.e. defend against “inference attacks” [42]).
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we necessarily binned users into categories
along the urban and rural spectrum. There is without a doubt
a tremendous amount of diversity in the people and
behaviors present within each of these categories, and further
research may want to address this. Categorizing users based
on behavior and content as opposed to demographic labels
could provide additional insight into who is likely to be
affected by these algorithmic biases.
Following best practices in the Twitter geolocation literature
(e.g. [27,33,34,52]), for our ground truth data, we depended
on explicitly geotagged tweets for our text-based algorithm
(i.e. tweet location) and a very conservative (i.e. precisionfocused rather than recall-focused) geocoding of the location
field for our network-based algorithm (i.e. user home
location). While doing so was critical to our goal of
evaluating bias in the algorithms as they were published, it is
possible that these mechanisms may disproportionally
remove people of one demographic relative to another
demographic. Although developing a ground truth through
other means (e.g. a survey) would be a major research project
in its own right, examining Twitter geolocation algorithms
through this lens would be a useful addition to the literature.
Another area of future work would be expanding the focus
of this study (the contiguous United States) to other cultures
and geographic contexts. It is known that different cultures
use social media differently (and have their own population
biases) so it is not clear how our results would extend to these
areas. Furthermore, building on our understanding of how
different populations use social media (e.g., variation of the
use of mentions across cultures [20]) will enable better
prediction of where algorithmic biases might arise. Along the
same lines, we sought to choose representative algorithms,
but different algorithms may perform differently and
introduce their own structural biases.
Finally, now that this paper has established the role of
structural bias, a very important direction of future work is
finding ways to reduce or eliminate it in important
algorithms. We expect that doing so could lead to an
interesting and fruitful line of work.

CONCLUSION

This research improves our understanding of algorithmic
biases in social media-based algorithms. We demonstrated
the degree to which these algorithmic biases arise from both
population biases in the training data and structural biases
inherent to the algorithms themselves. Through the
implementation of both a text-based and a network-based
algorithm for geolocation inference, we found that networkbased approaches may be less susceptible to structural
biases. We also discussed the implications of our findings for
designers and users of social-media based algorithms. These
implications include (1) the need for more work developing
algorithms that avoid the structural biases we observed here
and (2) that global evaluation metrics can mask significant
underperformance for certain populations in these
algorithms.
