## Computer Simulations in Science
First published Mon May 6, 2013; substantive revision Thu Feb 19, 2026

Computer simulations were first introduced to scientific inquiry in
meteorology and nuclear physics in the period directly following World
War II. Since then, they have become ubiquitous – and in some
cases indispensable – in a growing number of disciplines in both
the natural and social sciences as well as in engineering. In the
21st century, the list of sciences that make use of
computer simulations has grown to include astrophysics, particle
physics, materials science, engineering, fluid mechanics, climate
science, evolutionary biology, ecology, economics, decision theory,
sociology, epidemiology, and even medicine. If we understand computer
simulations as scientific instruments, as some philosophers of science
have recently suggested, they can be said to be one of the most widely
used and versatile instruments in science.

Philosophical debates about computer simulations have, for several
decades, oscillated between viewing them as extensions of modeling
practices and as analogues to experimentation. While early accounts
emphasized their continuity with mathematical modeling (Frigg and
Reiss 2009), others highlighted their experimental, empirical aspects.
On the one hand, given the similarity of computer simulations to
theoretical and abstract elements of scientific inquiry, some
philosophers initially sought to understand computer simulations from
the perspective of the philosophy of modeling. Under views like these,
the consensus was that there is little philosophical novelty to their
nature, their role, or their use (Frigg and Reiss 2009). On the other
hand, as a direct response to the perceived limitations and
inadequacies of this paradigm – and mirroring an entrenched
dichotomy in philosophy of science concerning theory and experiment
– views emerged that sought to understand computer simulations
as more closely related to empirical practices found in
experimentation. Thus, a pendulum-like debate dynamic between these
two camps dominated philosophical discourse on the topic for the most
part of a quarter of a century.

More recently, alternative views have emerged that treat computer
simulations as distinct from both models and experiments. While some
of these alternative views compare them to broader elements of
scientific inquiry such as methods or practices, others suggest that
computer simulations should be philosophically understood and treated
more like the things – namely scientific instruments –
that are used either to substantiate theoretical elements of inquiry
or to carry out experimental practices.

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 What is a computer simulation?

Because the role of computer simulations varies across disciplines and
experimental aims, a single definition to capture their use and import
may prove inadequate. Nevertheless, understanding the different senses
in which one can recognize what a computer simulation is and does can
elucidate the philosophical questions at play as well as the
implications of their possible answers. In this section, a few
definitions are provided and surveyed.

##### 1.1.1 A Narrow Definition

In its narrowest sense, a computer simulation is a program that is run
on a computer and that uses step-by-step methods to explore the
approximate behavior of a mathematical model. This simulation model is
a discretized approximation of a mathematical model coded in an
algorithm that is meant to capture numerical values associated with
the dynamic behavior of a real-world system. When run on a computer,
the algorithm thus produces a numerical picture of the evolution of
the system’s state. Under this narrow understanding, computer
simulations are simply equation solvers. In other words,
computer simulations simulate the steps to solve an equation, which,
in turn, are supposed to simulate the dynamics of a system. It should
be noted that discretizing continuous equations means that the
original equations of a mathematical model are not, technically
speaking, solved. Rather, their output values are merely approximated
to some acceptable degree of accuracy

The sequence of values generated by each running iteration can be
saved as a large “data” collection and visualized on a
computer screen. Often, although not always, the methods of
visualization are designed to mimic the output of a scientific
instrument. This gives the appearance that the simulation is measuring
a system, say atmospheric pressure or ocean currents.

Sometimes, the step-by-step methods of computer simulations are used
because the model of interest involves continuous (differential)
equations that cannot be solved analytically, whether in practice or
in principle. This is what Paul Humphreys meant to capture when he
defined computer simulation as “any computer-implemented method
for exploring the properties of mathematical models where analytic
methods are not available” (1990, 500). However, computer
simulations are also used when this is not the case.

Importantly, discretizing continuous equations means that the original
equations of a mathematical model are not, technically speaking,
solved. Rather, their output values are merely hoped to be
approximated to some desired or acceptable degree of accuracy.
Furthermore, when referring to “a computer simulation” in
this narrow sense, we should be speaking of a particular
implementation of the algorithm on a particular digital computer,
written in a particular language, using a particular compiler, etc.,
since often, variations in any of these elements means that different
results can be obtained.

##### 1.1.2 A Broad Definition

In a broader sense, we can think of computer simulations not as a
particular algorithm, but rather comprehensive method for studying
systems that includes model selection, computational implementation,
visualization, interpretation, and the justification of
inferences-often involving choices and techniques that go beyond pure
mathematics or theory.

Winsberg (2003, 111) refers to this broader sense of computer
simulation as computer simulation studies and adds:
“Successful simulation studies do more than compute numbers.
They make use of a variety of techniques to draw inferences from these
numbers. Simulations make creative use of calculational techniques
that can only be motivated extra-mathematically and
extra-theoretically.” That is, some of the techniques involved
in computer simulations are not necessarily guided by purely
mathematical or theoretical considerations. Rather, engineering
considerations such as computing costs, representational
intelligibility, coding language constraints, etc., will determine the
processes involved. Because of this, Winsberg further warns that
“unlike simple computations that can be carried out on a
computer, the results of simulations are not automatically
reliable” (2010 Ch.3). Rather, much effort and expertise from a
motley set of domains is required to sanction this process.

##### 1.1.3 Alternative views

Both narrow and broad definitions above treat computer simulations as
fundamentally about solving, or approximating, the equations of a
model representing a target system. An alternative, compositional
approach defines a computer simulation as a simulation – i.e.,
any system believed or intended to mimic another –
implemented on a digital computer (Weisberg 2013). This
latter point is in line with the definition of simulation we find in
Hartmann: i.e., “a process that imitates one process by another
process” where the term ‘process’ refers
“solely to some object or system whose state changes in
time” (1996, 83). A shortcoming of this definition however,
according to some, was that it leaves out simulations that mimic a
system’s structure and not its dynamics (Hughes 1999).
Considering this definition and this criticism, Humphreys revised his
definition as follows:

System S provides a core simulation of an object or process B just in
case S is a concrete computational device that produces, via a
temporal process, solutions to a computational model […] that
correctly represents B, either dynamically or statistically. If in
addition the computational model used by S correctly represents the
structure of the real system R, the S provides a core simulation of
system R with respect to B. (2004, 110)

This definition incorporates some of the elements discussed above: it
is a general definition of computer simulations as a solver, but there
is a compositional element that distinguishes the computer simulation
as a computational device from just a computational model. This
definition accommodates the possibility that a computer simulation
could simulate either the structural or dynamic properties of a
system.

Furthermore, there is a conceptual novelty to centering a
“concrete computational device” that proved highly
influential in the literature (Keller 2003). Wendy Parker (2009), for
example, argues that it is this material element of computer
simulations that makes simulation epistemologically on a par with
conventional experimentation. While conventional views suggested that
computer simulations are significantly distinct and epistemically
inferior to established empirical methods because they lack
materiality and can only deal with conceptual abstractions, others
offered that this materiality suggested by Humphreys implied that a
simulation must share some material, structural, or procedural
properties with either the dynamic properties of the target
system’s behavior or with the entirety of an experimental set up
(for an early overview of this latter debate see Fox-Keller (2003),
Winsberg (2010), or Durán and Arnold (2013); for a more formal
response to the former issue see Primiero’s (2020 Ch.14) chapter
on simulationism).

Some philosophers suggested that these similarities could be found in
the entirety of the implementation of a simulation process, which
include the data curation, architecture specification, scientific
theory and expertise, etc. This is particularly the case if one thinks
of computer simulations as simulation studies where computer
simulations are neither the experiment itself (e.g., merely the
controlled interventions on numerical values) nor just a theoretical
representation (e.g., an equation, model, etc.).

More recently, Alvarado (2023) has suggested that the material element
in Humphreys’ definition be brought to the fore in a different
way. Alvarado suggests we take seriously the concrete
computational devices at the core of computer simulations. Thus,
Alvarado offers the following definition of computer simulations as a
complex technical artifact:

A computer simulation is a procedurally arranged assemblage of
concrete computational devices that produces intelligible solutions,
via temporal processes, to a representational abstraction designed or
hypothesized to mimic another system or process. (2023, 90)

This definition is distinct from the alternatives surveyed above in
that it leaves the concept of representational abstraction maximally
open: a computer simulation could simulate a theoretically informed
model, a set of behavioral rules, or even just a hypothesized causal
sketch. Furthermore, this definition captures other intuitive
desiderata missing from Humphreys’ definition. For example, it
captures the possibility that a computer simulation can be a computer
simulation even if it fails to “correctly represent” the
system being simulated. Technical artifacts, unlike abstract formal
methods, can fail to do what they are designed to do whilst persisting
as the thing they were meant to be. Alvarado suggests that this
conceptual strategy towards understanding computer simulations as
instruments brings questions about their epistemic status back to the
realm of engineered and programmed devices and away from abstract
objects such as models and equations (Schiaffonati and Verdicchio
2013). This strategy centers on the properties of the simulation in
the same way we do with other instruments whose reliability is in
question. At the same time, Alvarado argues, this definition can make
sense of the fact that simulations, like other instruments deployed in
science, go through a long and arduous process of engineering
refinement and calibration in which their success and fitness is
temporarily unclear. This has, as we will see in
section 2.4
below, important ramifications for questions about the epistemic
status of computer simulations in science.

The instrument view of computer simulation is certainly not the first
nor the only view pushing against the conventional dichotomy in the
literature. Alvarado’s instrument view is in fact an outlier in
its rather narrow approach to the issue, single-mindedly focusing on
the artifactual nature of computer simulations. However, we can see
insightful responses against the dichotomous pendulum described above
as early as two decades ago (Winsberg 2003) that see computer
simulations as part of a broader set of practices and expertise.
Unfortunately, these broader alternative accounts on the nature of
computer simulations have only emerged intermittently, punctuating the
debate with corrections and foregrounding the importance of
sociological details of the practice of simulating. Many others
continue to anchor their analysis of the epistemic role, import, and
nature of computer simulations on issues of representation and
borrowing almost exclusively from conceptual frameworks in the
philosophical literature on models and modeling (Durán 2020;
Tolk et al 2023; Páez 2024).

A more recent interpretation away from the pendulum described above
between theory and experimentation is provided by Durán (2024).
According to Durán, computer simulations are also not just
intermediaries in-between theory and experimentation, as Rohrlich
(1990) suggested. The prevailing view, Durán argues, is rather
that computer-based methodologies “extend the class of tractable
mathematics and representation and thereby broadening the ranges of
modeling (Morgan 2003), observations (Beisbart 2017), predictions
(Parker 2014), measurements (Morrison 2009; Tal 2011), and explanation
of phenomena (Durán 2017), among several other scientific
endeavors.” (Durán 2024) When it comes to computer
simulation, this means that they are “not just an intermediate
between two familiar ends, but rather a scientific methodology in its
own right.” (ibid.) Notice here that the emphasis on the term
‘methodology’ is is meant to draw a distinction between
those who see computer simulations as a motely set of experimental
practices, aided in part through computational methods, and those who
think the modeling aspect of computer simulations is in itself the
method, and a new one at that (Lenhard 2019).

This perspective echoes Winsberg’s notion of simulation
studies, which emphasizes the heterogeneous expertise required
for exploring models, computational architectures, and implementation
strategies (Winsberg 2010). Similarly, according to Primiero (2020,
235), a “simulation in this sense, is meant not only as the
artefact which implements a model, but it indicates the whole process
of experimentation.” Accordingly, and closely following
Winsberg’s simulation pipeline, Primiero (2020) explains that
the methods and processes for studying systems include things like
“designing the formal model, translating that model to an
algorithm, implementing the algorithm in a language, devising an
experiment based on running the algorithm on a computer, calculating
the output of an algorithm, and studying the resultant data (possibly
through visualization)” (p. 237). Furthermore, drawing from
Morrison (2015, 248) Primiero adds, “simulations combine the
very core of the three levels of abstraction of computing we are
investigating, namely the formal, the linguistic, and the physical
[…] As such, the epistemic status of computer simulations
reflect the whole complexity of experimental design”
(p.238).

#### 1.2 Types and Purposes of Computer Simulations

Two types of computer simulation are often distinguished:
equation-based simulations and agent-based
simulations. Computer simulations of both types are used for
three different general sorts of purposes: prediction, understanding,
and exploratory or heuristic purposes. Often, however, they are mainly
used for prediction and can help scientist measure their expectations
about a system of interest under a particular set of circumstances.
This predictive power can also be run backwards to try to understand,
in a retrodictive way, the possible paths that gave rise to a given
state of affairs in a system. These predictions and retrodictions can
be further split into three categories: point predictions,
qualitative/global/systemic predictions, and range predictions. Point
predictions are about the possible future state of a point of
interest, say the position of a planet on a given date. Global
predictions are about elucidating guiding principles, emerging rules
and/or tendencies of a whole system. And the latter give us
information about expected ranges in which we may find a target
variable or state of a system. Understanding these uses goes hand in
hand with understanding distinct kinds of computer simulations.
Elucidating the latter is the aim of this section.

##### 1.2.1 Equation-Based Simulations

Equation-based simulations are the most commonly used in sciences
where there is an established governing theory or global theoretical
principles that explain the relationship between the mathematical
equations of a model and the dynamic behavior of a target system.
Thus, the term ‘equation’ here is meant to refer to
simulations whose operations are based on the kinds of continuous
equations found in scientific theories and not just rules of behavior
or rules of evolution. These equations can be of two kinds. They can
be particle-based, where the behavior and interactions of many
discrete agents are regulated by a set of differential equations; or
they can be field-based, where there is a set of equations governing
the time evolution of a continuous medium or field. An example of the
former is a simulation of a galaxy formation, in which the
gravitational interaction between a finite collection of discrete
bodies or objects is discretized in time and space. An example of the
latter is the simulation of a fluid, such as a meteorological system
like a severe storm. In this latter example the system is treated as a
continuous medium – a fluid – and a field representing its
distribution of the relevant variables is discretized in space and
then updated in discrete intervals of time.

As we will see in detail in other sections below, this discretization
processes will prove to be a non-trivial epistemological
consideration.

##### 1.2.2 Agent-based Simulations

Agent-Based simulations are most common in the social and behavioral
sciences, though we also find them in such disciplines as
epidemiology, ecology, and any discipline in which the networked
interaction of many individuals is being studied. Agent-based
simulations are like particle-based simulations in that they represent
behavior of many discrete individuals. Unlike particle-based
equation-based simulations however, there are no global differential
equations that govern the motions of the individuals. Rather, in
agent-based simulations the behavior of the individual is specified
via their own local rules.

An example of these kinds of equation is Schelling’s
‘segregation model’ (1971). The agents in this simulation
are squares of two different colors on a chess board. Each square is
coded with preferences about the vicinity of similar or distinct
squares. Schelling found that both heavy and mild threshold
preferences towards similar squares yielded fully
‘segregated’ grids after several iterations solving for
the rules.

##### 1.2.3 Multiscale Simulations

Some simulations are hybrids of different kinds of modelling methods
and of different types of implementation and engineering strategies.
Often, these simulations involve coupling simulations from different
scales of description. Carrying out simulations of weather prediction
systems, for example, often involves the ‘stitching’
together simulations of different levels of specific atmospheric
phenomena such as cloud formation, water current patterns,
temperature, etc. (Winsberg 2010; Gehring 2017; Gransche 2017).

Multiscale simulation methods can be further broken down to into two
kinds: parallel multiscale and serial multiscale method. The latter is
the more traditional method, and it involves choosing a region,
running simulations at the lower level of description, summarizing the
results into a set of parameters/values that can be processed by the
higher-level model, and passing them up into the part of the algorithm
calculating at the higher level. One can visualize such a process by
thinking of a divisible grid in which the states of higher-level
square regions are calculated in virtue of operations and calculations
done at finer-grained level squares and then added up to a value
recognized at higher levels of abstraction. These kinds of multiscale
simulation methods are limited and do not work when the different
scales at play are strongly codependent. In such cases, where the
different scales interact strongly to produce observed behavior,
parallel multiscale simulations – in which each region is
simulated simultaneously – is used.

This latter technique is the foundation of a widespread method called
‘sub-grid modelling’ which is used in climate science and
kindred disciplines and refers to the procedures used in transforming
values to be processed across scales. In a numbered line, for example,
one may have decimals and operations at the decimal level (say
division) that fail to yield definite whole numbers. The calculations
at the decimal level, however, may be part of a larger process that
requires or is only able to process discrete whole numbers. In such a
case, we may develop a rule or an operation such as ‘if output
of decimal operations yields >.5 round up, if <.5 round
down’ which would yield a value output that can be processed at
the higher-level resolution. Similarly, in parallel multiscale,
sub-grid modelling refers to the method of replacing processes –
ones that are too small-scale or complex to be physically represented
in the model – by a simpler mathematical description. This is
called parametrization and it involves the consideration of
non-physical parameters to drive the highly approximative algorithms
that compute the sub-grid values. As such, these parameters may be
determined by extra-mathematical and extra-theoretical considerations
and constraints, a detail which will become important in our
discussion on the epistemology of computer simulations and whether
these methods are similar to ordinary mathematical procedures.

Sub-grid simulation processes of this kind can also be contrasted with
another kind of parallel multiscale model where the sub-grid
algorithms are more theoretically principled but are motivated by a
theory at a different level of description. For example, we may
observe a behavior in a system for which we have no theoretical
framework, and we may try to simulate it by appealing to a
smaller-level phenomena for which the computations and models are more
theoretically grounded. Hence, the sub-grid calculations are more
theoretically supported than the phenomena we are trying to simulate
at the higher level. These kinds of multiscale models, in other words,
cobble together the resources of theories at different levels of
description.

##### 1.2.4 Monte Carlo Simulations

There is another large class of computer simulations called Monte
Carlo Simulations. These simulations are computer algorithms that use
randomness to calculate the properties of a mathematical model and
where the randomness of the algorithm is not a feature of the original
target model. A good example of this is the use of a random algorithm
to calculate the value of Pi. If you draw a unit square on a piece of
paper and draw a circle in it, and then randomly drop a collection of
objects inside the square, the proportion of objects that land in the
circle would be roughly equal to pi divided by 4. Simulating such a
process on a computer can be called a Monte Carlo Simulation of
Pi.

Some philosophers do not see Monte Carlo Simulations as genuine
simulations, since they do not seem to have a “mimetic
purpose” in relation to a target system and hence do not
represent, stand for, or simulate anything. Rather, it is argued, the
Monte Carlo method “imitates the deterministic system not in
order to serve as a surrogate that is investigated in its stead but
only in order to offer an alternative computation of the determinist
system’s properties.” (Grune-Yanoff and Weirich 2010, 30).
This shows that Monte Carlo simulations do not fit any of the above
definitions aptly. On the other hand, this tension can be solved by
noting that Monte Carlo simulations simulate an imaginary process for
calculating something relevant to studying some other process. This is
the sense in which Monte Carlo simulations are simulations, i.e., they
are not simulations of a target system but of some other necessary
procedure. Only when those simulations are in fact of systems that
happen to be stochastic dynamic systems, can they be said to be a
simulation of that system, as noted by Beisbart and Norton (2012;
Duran 2024, 152).

##### 1.2.5 Computer Simulations, Machine Learning and Generative AI

Computer simulations and artificial intelligence methods are quite
distinct. They function through distinct principles and are often used
to solve distinct problems. Computer simulations are, for the most
part, used in contexts in which data has been previously gathered and
curated with some level of scientific rigor and where established
theoretical principles and causal connections can be assumed to a
certain extent. On the other hand, machine learning methods are often
deployed for problems in which such causal relationships are not known
or are simply not present. Nevertheless, in certain data-intensive
scientific contexts, say particle physics and astrophysics, the
distinct enhancing and analyzing capacities of these two methods are
regularly used together, even if they are devoted to distinct
subtasks.

While both machine learning techniques and computer simulations can be
used to explore possible modeling approaches, the computing resources
to build and run computer simulations make it so that machine learning
techniques often prove – in certain experimental contexts
– to be much more efficient tools to explore plausible models.
While parameters and considerations can be adjusted in a computer
simulation to model variations in a given model, a whole range of
plausible models can be explored with machine learning. Hence, recent
developments in both computer simulation, machine learning techniques,
and generative AI have led to the development of systems that
integrate these distinct technologies. After all, at a high-enough
level of abstraction, both methods can be said to have a similar aim:
to predict the possible states of a system (Johnson and Lenhard 2024;
Symons and Boschetti 2013; Kaminski et al. 2023; Ferrario et al.
2024). These integrations can take at least two different modalities:
machine learning-assisted computer simulation and computer
simulation-assisted machine learning.

Machine learning-assisted computer simulation can happen at different
stages of the construction of computer simulations. It can help
scientists who are still working out the details of a possible model
by supporting the search for more efficient and cost-effective
solutions, or to detect patterns in the data that need to be accounted
for in the simulation process. Interestingly, machine learning
techniques have been successfully deployed to help with the kind of
sub-grid parametrization discussed in the subsection above. Kawamleh
(2021), for example, provides a few case studies of the use of
artificial neural networks to help with parametrization and argues
that, due to the scale of climate simulations and the limitation in
conventional computing power, the non-linear functions that describe
climate processes must be approximated. According to Kawamleh,
artificial neural networks have a specific function – the
universal approximation function – “that enables [them] to
approximate any nonlinear deterministic function.” Hence, she
continues, artificial neural networks represent “a promising
method by which scientists can better incorporate cloud-related
processes, like convection, which cannot be adequately represented by
physical equations in GCM.” (Kawamleh 2021, 1012) Ultimately,
however, Kawamleh is skeptical that machine learning can be used
reliably, particularly when compared to models based in
physical/causal principles.

Computer simulation-assisted machine learning, on the other hand,
often uses a simulation to enhance an algorithm’s learning
processes by providing more and often better data: e.g., a
machine-learning algorithm designed for autonomous vehicles can
benefit from a physics engine or a driving simulator’s data.
Computer simulations can also be used to test or corroborate machine
learning results: e.g., when a generative AI model suggests a material
for an engineering project, or a novel way of folding a protein.

These integration efforts are relatively new and the role of each of
the methods and the epistemological implications related to their
combined used have only recently began to be explored by philosophers
of science.

### 2. The Epistemology of Computer Simulations

As can be gathered by now, a central concern in the dichotomous
debates mentioned above about the nature of computer simulations
– between those that understood computer simulations as more
closely related to formal methods (e.g., modeling), and those that
compare them to empirical practices (e.g., experiments) – has
been their epistemic import and status. However, as we will see in
this section, simply importing considerations from existing debates in
the epistemology of science onto the philosophy of computer
simulations has proven to be a non-trivial task. For example, as
Winsberg (1999) noted a quarter century ago, when it comes to
sanctioning knowledge claims, most philosophy of science has focused
on the justification of theories, while the epistemology of computer
simulations is mainly about the justification of the results of
computer simulations that already used established theoretical basis
for their functioning. Others have appealed to the novelty of computer
simulations to suggest that a new epistemological framework is
required to address their epistemological import. More recently, some
of the conceptual differences and disputes in these conversations have
been attended by philosophers (See Alvarado 2022) who suggest that
computer simulations and their epistemic status should be understood
by revisiting insights, often overlooked by philosophers of science,
from the epistemology of instruments (Baird 2004; Humphreys 2004). The
relevant question in all these approaches is whether or not the
processes and the results of a particular computer simulations can be
expected to be reliable for their intended purpose.

In what follows we will introduce some of the key questions
surrounding the conventional debates in the epistemology of computer
simulations as well as some of the implications of more recent
contributions.

#### 2.1 Models, Experiment, and Novelty

As briefly stated above, a natural philosophical position to take
vis-à-vis the epistemological role of computer simulations is
to see them as an extension of formal mathematical methods. After all,
early computer simulations were simply designed as solvers. What they
simulated was the solving of a mathematical problem. Since the
problems these early simulations were solving involved complex-enough
equations – and some of these equations were designed/meant to
represent the complex dynamics of a target system, then the conceptual
move from interpreting them as mere solvers to interpreting them as
richer representational devices such as models was not too
far-fetched. If computer simulations are anything special, so the
argument would go, they are special kinds of mathematical models or
simple extensions of these models (See Weisberg 2013).

One of the assumed implications of this position was that there was
nothing philosophically or epistemologically new to computer
simulations and that most of the conceptual work required to
understand them could be drawn from existing philosophical literature
on models in scientific inquiry. Questions regarding the novelty, or
lack thereof, of computer simulations sparked a lively decade-long
debate about the epistemic status of computer simulations and what
philosophers of science could say about them (See, Humphreys 2009;
Frigg and Reiss 2009).

Settling the novelty question in a definite manner may, prima facie,
appear to be, at best, an unnecessary philosophical difficulty, and,
at worst, a hindering distraction. Nevertheless, there are non-trivial
distinctions and implications underlying this debate that one must
consider before dismissing this dilemma.

For example, as we briefly mentioned in the introduction to this
section, traditional philosophy of science is often concerned with
issues related to theory confirmation. In contrast, epistemological
debates related to computer simulations have been more attentive to
the adequate application of established theoretical
frameworks when available and to the comparative status of
results in simulation studies. More particularly, according to
Winsberg (1999), an adequate epistemological framework must account
for the fact that knowledge produced by computer simulations is the
result of inferences that are downward, motely and autonomous. This
means the following:

Downward: in large number of cases, accepted
scientific theories are the starting point for the construction of
computer simulations. These theories play an important role in the
justification of inferences from simulations results to conclusions
about target systems.

Motley: results of simulations depend not just on
theory but many other extra-theoretical considerations, including
considerations about parametrizations, numerical solution methods,
mathematical and coding tricks, approximations, fictions, hardware, as
well as on laborious empirical calibration efforts.

Autonomous: the knowledge produced by simulation
cannot be sanctioned entirely by comparison with observation.
Simulations are usually employed to study phenomena where data are
sparse and conventional empirical experimentation may be beyond reach
for principled, practical or ethical reasons.

And yet, while these characteristics could be taken as distinguishing
features between computer simulations and other methods, practices, or
even instruments in scientific inquiry, some philosophers (e.g.,
Parker 2013) have made the point that the usefulness of these
conditions is somewhat compromised by the fact that they are overly
focused on simulation in the physical sciences and others disciplines
where simulation is theory-driven and equation-based. This seems
correct. In the social and behavioral sciences, and other disciplines
where agent-based simulation are more the norm, and where models are
built in the absence of established and quantitative theories,
epistemological frameworks should probably be characterized in
different terms.

For instance, some scientists who use agent-based simulation pursue a
methodology in which social phenomena (for example an observed pattern
like segregation) is accounted for by merely generating
similar-looking phenomena in their simulations (Epstein and
Axtell 1996; Epstein 1999). This raises its own epistemological
questions about the adequacy of these computational methods and their
dynamic features, about their truth, and about their explanatory
power, if any (See Grüne-Yanoff 2007; Paez 2009). Giuseppe
Primiero (2020) argues that there is a whole domain of
“artificial sciences” built around agent-based and
multi-agent system-based simulations that requires its own
epistemology – one where validation cannot be defined by
comparison with an existing real-world system but rather must be
defined vis-à-vis an intended system.

It is also fair to say, as Parker does (2013), that the conditions
outlined above pay insufficient attention to the various and differing
purposes for which simulations are used. If we are using a simulation
to make detailed quantitative predictions about the future behavior of
a target system, the epistemology of such inferences might require
more stringent standards than those that are involved when the
inferences being made are about the general, qualitative behavior of a
whole class of systems.

Adding to this criticism, Frigg and Reiss (2009) also argued that none
of these three conditions are new to computer simulation. They argued
that ordinary ‘paper and pencil’ modeling incorporate
these features. Indeed, they argued that computer simulation could not
possibly raise new epistemological issues. This is because such
epistemological issues could be cleanly divided into existing
questions: first, into the question of the appropriateness of the
model underlying the simulation, which is an issue that is identical
to the epistemological issues that arise in ordinary modeling; and
second, the question of the correctness of the solution to the model
equations delivered by the simulation, which is a mathematical
question, and not one related to the epistemology of science. On the
first point, Winsberg (2009b) replied that it was the simultaneous
confluence of all the features that was new to simulation.

As we will see, these issues become even more complex as some
philosophers suggest that computer simulations – while indeed
sharing some of their properties with existing methods and practices
– are nonetheless special cases of these methods.

In the debates regarding the novelty of computer simulations, a
distinction can be drawn between those who understand computer
simulations as new, special kinds of models or modeling
techniques – e.g., Lenhard (2019) and Morrison (2015) –
and those who understand them more broadly as new
methodologies and practices which involve modeling, engineering, and
experimentation considerations. Within this latter paradigm, computer
simulations are not just new kinds of models, but rather a whole new
methodology for inquiry (Duran 2024). Galison (1997), for example,
argues that, while earlier analog computer simulations of the kind
used during the second world war can be easily understood in the same
way we understand other physical models. Galison argues,
nevertheless, that the novel practice of computer simulation brought
about a radical epistemological transformation in physics, pushing
“physics into a place paradoxically dislocated from the
traditional reality that borrowed from both experimental and
theoretical domains” and hence created a sort of
“netherland that was at once nowhere and everywhere on the
methodological map.” For some, Galison’s point means that
computer simulations are a special case of modeling (Lenhard 2019);
for others, this represents a new kind of experimentation practice
(Morrison 2015; Ruphy 2015). Furthermore, some of these issues will be
put on a different light when considered from the perspective of the
epistemology of instruments in science. For Alvarado, for example,
computer simulations are neither a new kind of model nor a new kind of
experimental practice, but rather a new kind of
instrument.

As we will see, many of the issues surrounding the nature and
epistemological status of computer simulations, often revolve around
three main questions: What are they? What do they do? And how do they
do it? In the latter category one can find questions concerning the
relation between a simulation and their targets. Accounting for the
relation between computer simulations and their target is a
non-trivial endeavor that has motivated several book-length projects
in the last two decades (See Humphreys 2004; Winsberg 2010; Weisberg
2013; Morrison 2015; Lenhard 2019). In a sense, it is true that some
of the questions arising for simulation will not be very different
from some of the questions asked of modeling in general (Humphreys and
Imbert 2013). One can say, for instance, that simulations and models
do share some of the same problems concerning their representational
status vis-a-vis target phenomena, i.e. the thing they are supposed to
represent. And yet, they only share these problems in virtue of being
representational devices. These are questions that both models and
simulations would also share with moving cartoons, data visualization
techniques, a child’s drawing, a thermometer, or an equation.
This is simply too broad of a problem to infer that because of this
shared philosophical issue, computer simulations and models must be
similar in other substantial ways.

##### 2.1.1 Epistemology of experimentation and computer simulations

Many of the important contributions in the understanding of computer
simulations has come from views that have drawn analogies between the
practice of computer simulation and the motely set of skills
accompanying the empirical methods and practices of experimentation.
Developments in the epistemology of experiments in physics have been
of particular influence. In his work on the epistemology of
experiment, for example, Franklin (1986; 1989) identified several
strategies that experimenters use to increase rational confidence in
their results and philosophers such as Wendy Parker (2008a) argued for
various forms of analogy between these successful strategies and other
strategies available to simulationists to sanction their results.

Drawing inspiration from another philosopher of experiment (Mayo
1996), Parker (2008b) suggest that an error-statistical approach for
understanding the traditional experiment – which makes use of
Mayo’s notion of a “severe test” – could shed
light on the epistemology of simulation. The central question under
this framework becomes about our warrants to conclude that the
simulation would be unlikely to give the results that it in fact gave,
if the hypothesis of interest were false (2008b, 380). Parker further
believes that too much of what passes for simulation model evaluation
lacks this kind of questioning since they mainly consist of
“little more than side-by-side comparison of simulation output
and observational data.” (2008b, 381) Drawing explicitly from
Mayo’s (1996) work, Parker argues that what the epistemology of
simulation ought to be doing is offering some account of the
‘canonical errors’ that can arise, as well as strategies
for probing for their presence.

In a similar move towards the epistemology of experiment but drawing
from a distinct approach in the philosophy of science, Winsberg (2003)
makes use of Ian Hacking’s (1983; 1988; 1992) work. In
particular, Winsberg takes note of one of Hacking’s central
insight that ‘experiments have a life of their own’ (1992,
306). According to Winsberg, Hacking intended to convey two things:
first – as a direct reaction against Kuhn’s unstable
picture of science – Hacking suggests that experimental results
can remain stable even in the face of dramatic changes in other parts
of science; and second, that “experiments are organic, advance,
change and yet retain certain long-term developments which makes us
talk about repeating and replicating” them (1992, 307).
According to Winsberg, some of the techniques that simulationists use
to construct their models get credentialed in much the same way that
Hacking says that instruments and experimental procedures and methods
do; the credentials develop over an extended period of time and become
deeply tradition-bound. In Hacking’s language, the techniques
and sets of assumptions that simulationists use become
‘self-vindicated’. This move seems to provide a plausible
response to the problem of understanding how simulations could have a
viable epistemology despite the motely and autonomous nature of the
inferences required to validate their results. And it may very well
apply to ongoing practices and methodology in inquiry. If one
understands, as Winsberg does, computer simulations as encompassing
the practices and methodologies surrounding their construction, as
simulation studies (2010), then it is a move forward in a plausible
epistemology of computer simulations.

Nevertheless, it is worthy of notice that a confusion may arise here
with the assertions that computer simulations or any other kind of
instrument and method “carry their own credentials”,
“become self-vindicated”, or “are
self-sanctioning.” This is particularly the case if what is
meant implies saying that these instruments, simply in doing what they
do when they do it and how they do it, become sanctioned, warranted,
vindicated, as if automatically. Whether it is the case that computer
simulations – either as a method or as devices – can be
self-sanctioning, is not immediately obvious. (See
section 2.3.)

##### 2.1.2 Simulation and Experiment

Considering the extra mathematical elements in computer simulations,
some philosophers have more recently argued that there must be more to
computer simulations than just their formal elements. Yet, this
connection between simulation and experiment can be traced back as far
as von Neumann, who, when advocating very early on for the use of
computers in physics, noted that many difficult experiments had to be
conducted merely to determine facts that ought, in principle, to be
derivable from theory. Once von Neumann’s vision became a
reality, and some of these experiments began to be replaced by
simulations, it became somewhat natural to view them as versions of
experiment.

The idea of “in silico” experiments becomes even more
plausible when a simulation is designed to learn what happens to a
system as a result of various possible interventions. Philosophers,
consequently, begun to consider in what sense, if any, computer
simulations are like experiments and in what sense they differ. A
number of views have emerged in the literature centered around
defending and criticizing two main theses:

The identity thesis: computer simulations are
literally instances of experiments.

The epistemological dependence thesis: The identity
thesis would (if true) be a good reason (weak version), or the best
reason (strong version), or the only reason (strongest version) to
believe that simulations can provide warrants for belief in the
hypotheses they support.

The central idea behind the epistemological dependence thesis is that
experiments are the canonical entities that play a central role in
warranting our belief in scientific hypotheses, and that therefore the
degree to which we ought to think that simulations can also play a
role in warranting such beliefs depends on the extent to which they
can be identified as a kind of experiment. One can find philosophers
of science arguing for the identity thesis as early as Humphreys
(1995) and Hughes (1999). And there is at least implicit support for
the stronger version of the epistemological dependence thesis in
Hughes. The earliest explicit argument in favor of the epistemological
dependence thesis, however, is in Norton and Suppes (2001). According
to them, simulations can warrant belief precisely because they
literally are experiments. They have a detailed story to tell about
how this is the case and how it works. According to them, a valid
simulation is one in which certain formal relations hold between a
base model, the modeled physical system itself, and the computer
running the algorithms. When the proper conditions are met, “a
simulation can be used as an instrument for probing or detecting real
world phenomena. Empirical data about real phenomena are produced
under conditions of experimental controls” (p. 73) just like in
experiments.

One problem with this story is that the formal conditions that they
set out (See Norton and Suppe 2001) are much too strict and seldom met
by either the model, the modeled physical system, the computer
machinery or the algorithms therein. It is unlikely that there are
very many real examples of computer simulations that meet their strict
standards. Simulation is almost always a far more idealizing and
approximating enterprise. So, if simulations are experiments, it is
probably not in the way Norton and Suppes imagined.

Parke (2014) argues against the epistemological dependency thesis by
undermining two premises that she believes support it: first, that
experiments generate greater inferential power than simulations, and
second, that simulations cannot surprise us in the same way that
experiments can. The argument that simulations cannot surprise us
comes from Morgan (2005). Following Morgan, Parke argues that
practitioners are indeed often surprised by their simulations, both
because they are not computationally omniscient, and because they are
not always the sole creators of the models and code they use. She
argues, moreover, that differences “in researcher’s
epistemic states, alone, seem like the wrong grounds for tracking a
distinction between experiment and simulation.” (p. 258). Adrian
Curry (2017) defends Morgan’s original intuition by making two
friendly amendments. He argues that the distinction Morgan was really
after was between two different kinds of surprise: when surprise is
due to bringing out theoretical knowledge in contact with the world,
simulations are distinct from experiment; he also more carefully
defines surprise in non-psychological terms such that it is a
“quality the attainment of which constitutes genuine epistemic
progress.” Both intuitions/positions are precisely what is at
the heart of Johannes Lenhard (2019) book-length treatise on the
subject: Calculated Surprises (2019).

More generally, the identity thesis has drawn fire from other
quarters. Gilbert and Troitzsch (1999) argued that “[t]he major
difference is that while in an experiment, one is controlling the
actual object of interest (for example, in a chemistry experiments,
the chemicals under investigation), in a simulation one is
experimenting with a model rather than the phenomenon itself.”
(1999, 13) This position, however, has many issues (see Guala 2002;
2008; Morgan 2003; Parker 2009; Winsberg 2009a). For example, it is
unclear what “manipulating” abstract entities means.
Furthermore, it is false that real experiments always manipulate
exactly their targets of interest. In fact, in both real experiments
and simulations, there is a complex relationship between what is
manipulated in the investigation on the one hand, and the real-world
systems that are the targets of the investigation on the other. In
cases of both experiment and simulation, therefore, it takes an
argument of some substance to establish the ‘external
validity’ of the investigation – i.e., to establish that
what is learned about the system being manipulated is applicable to
the system of interest.

One way to address this latter issue is to suggest, as Morrison (2015)
does, that in fact several well-regarded experimental practices in
well-established sciences such as particle physics are already
conducted in a way that share many epistemically relevant elements
with features of simulation practice. In particular, Morrison suggests
that much of what goes on in particle physics (or astrophysics), in
terms of experimentation, after certain empirical measurements provide
the necessary data, is mainly an exercise in the manipulation of
parameters and input values to understand possible/plausible dynamic
behaviors of the target system. Alvarado characterizes
Morrison’s views on these kinds of experiments the following
way:

while there may be a direct detection exercise through the means of an
apparatus, much of the experimental part is carried out when values
and parameters are examined formally […] While observations
about a star’s behavior may come directly from an event
perceived through a telescope, for example, much of the inferences and
explanations related to such an event happen once these observations
have been […] integrated into large-scale theoretical
frameworks. Once these values are integrated and both the assumptions
and the dynamics specified, they can be changed, played with –
in short, experimented upon. In this sense, the experiments are value
comparisons. (2023, p.40)

Hence, according to Morrison, insofar as the main function of computer
simulations consists of computing and elucidating the relationship
between theoretical values and their evolution, then they are very
similar to the kinds of experimental practices just described. That
is, both procedures involve the testing of parameters, the fine-tuning
of input values, the assessment of changes and effects in the dynamic
behavior of a system, and lastly the drawing of inferences related to
such processes. In this sense, computer simulations are indeed on a
par with experimental practices.

This is indeed an innovative approach to the debate. By focusing on
parameters and values, Morrison can overcome the objection to Gilbert
and Troitzsch’s idea that what we are manipulating are abstract
entities. It is evident that one can control and change input values
and measurement parameters of a formal system. More importantly, this
approach changes the directionality of the debate. Rather than trying
to argue that computer simulation practices can rise to the status of
empirical experimentation and thus inflate the epistemic status of
computer simulations, Morrison establishes that important
experimentation practices are already at the level of computer
simulations. According to Alvarado, this amounts to an empirically
deflationary position that, although thought-provoking within the
context of the debate, risks simply moving the goal post
vis-à-vis important questions about the relationship between
this type of experimentation methods, including computer simulations,
and real-world target systems. The main strength of Morrison’s
deflationary argumentative strategy is to provide a cornering argument
in which opponents must risk admitting that the well-established
practices in physics she is talking about do not in fact provide novel
and genuine knowledge about the world, a position that is not just
hard to defend but seems obviously misguided. If we accept that these
well-established experimentation practices are in fact just value
comparisons, and we accept that computer simulations are pretty much
the same, then we must accept that computer simulations also
constitute a reliable method to learn about the world. On the opposite
side of the coin, if we reject that computer simulations can be
reliable experimental practices because they are just value and
measurement comparisons, then we must reject many of the experimental
practices in particle physics or astrophysics. In any case, this
argument, however successful or not, may be limited to the kinds of
experiments in which the main phenomenon of interest – say
stars, social behaviors, or subatomic particles – is simply
beyond reach of conventional empirical experimentation methods.

Nevertheless, as Parker (2009) points out – and as the main gist
of Morrison’s argument above suggests – in both experiment
and simulation, we can have relevant similarities between both methods
and their target systems, and that is what matters. Furthermore, a
computer simulation of the solar system, based on our most
sophisticated models of celestial dynamics will provide better
representations of the planet’s orbits than any experiment may.
Some philosophers have made similar claims concerning computer
simulations in climate science. Petersen (2012), for example, suggests
that “the most complex simulations […] done using the
national supercomputer of the Netherlands were more reliable for
[…] research questions than were any of the sparse experimental
or observational results in the literature” (p. 3)

###### 2.1.2.1 Simulating an experiment versus experimenting on a simulation

Note that there is a related but separate issue concerning
computational systems as experimental mediators about their own
properties and that here too, distinctions ought to be cautiously
treated. Herbert Simon (1969) anticipated, in the early days of
computer simulations, that a simulation could be ran to experiment
with the limits and properties of the simulation process itself.
Hence, the computer simulation would become both the instrument with
which we investigate and the subject of inquiry at the same time (See
Schiaffonati 2017 for a thorough review of how experiments can be done
both with computing and in computing). This is anticipated by
Humphreys (2004) and something that Lenhard (2019) touches upon with
his notion of calculated surprises. Particularly in his
acknowledgment that the computer simulation is a tool to model models
and in his assertion that we can learn from computer simulations
details about their own properties with uses.

These latter points echo Schiaffonati’s notion of computer
simulations as exploratory experiments (Schiaffonati 2016;
Primiero 2020). Which signals novel epistemic implications. According
to Schiaffonati (2016) and Primero (2020), exploratory
experiments “are characterized by a lower degree of
constraining from the control part of the activity, often without the
guide of a formal model, and driven by the interest in verifying the
possibilities of an artefact.” (idem., 240). In this sense,
Primiero adds:

It is the experiment that guides the construction of the computational
model, or at least contributes to it. In this process, a computational
hypothesis is not conceptually prior to the design and execution of
the computational experiment: accordingly, control is a posteriori,
i.e. it is performed only at a much later stage and often contextually
to the artifact’s use. (p. 240)

These computer simulations are used, in Daterri and
Schiaffonati’s (2019; 2023) words, for surrogative
reasoning. Further, Primiero adds, in this sense the purpose and
context of the computer simulation changes and hence so does its
epistemic role, since such “exploration contributes to problem
solving rather than explanation or prediction.” (2020)

#### 2.2 Verification and Validation

Practitioners of simulation, particularly in engineering contexts, in
weapons testing, and in climate science, tend to conceptualize the
epistemology of computer simulations in terms of verification and
validation. Verification is said to be the process of determining
whether the output of the simulation approximates the true solutions
to the differential equations of the original model. Validation, on
the other hand, is said to be the process of determining whether the
chosen model is a good-enough representation of the target-system
for the purpose of the simulation. The literature on
verification and validation from engineers and scientist is enormous
and it has begun to receive some attention from philosophers (see
Durán 2018).

Verification can be divided into solution verification and code
verification. The former verifies that the output of the intended
algorithm approximates the true solutions to the differential
equations of the original model. The latter verifies that the code, as
written, carries out the intended algorithm. Code verification has
been mostly ignored by philosophers of science – probably
because it has been seen as more of a problem in computer science than
in empirical science – yet attention to these important issues,
particularly as they pertain to computational methods in scientific
inquiry, has changed in the last decade (see Symons and Horner 2014;
Horner and Symons 2020; Floridi et al. 2014; Primiero 2020). Although,
part of solution verification consists in comparing computed output
with analytic solutions (so called “benchmark solutions”),
simulations are often used precisely because analytic solutions are
unavailable for regions of solutions space that are of interest
(Humphreys 2004). Other indirect techniques are available: the most
important of which is probably checking to see whether and at what
rate computed output converges to a stable solution as the time and
spatial resolution of the discretization grid gets finer.

The principal strategy for validation, on the other hand, involves
comparing model output to observable data. Again, this strategy is
limited in most cases where simulations are being run because
observable data are sparse. But complex strategies can be employed,
including comparing the output of subsystems of a simulation to
relevant experiments (Parker 2013; Oberkampf and Roy 2010).

The concepts of verification and validation have drawn some criticism
from philosophers. Oreskes et al. (1994) in a widely cited article
argued that the terminology of “validity” is a property
that only applies to logical arguments and that hence the term, when
applied to simulations, might lead to overconfidence. Similarly,
although for distinct reasons and motivations, Winsberg (2018, 155)
has argued that the conceptual division between verification and
validation can be misleading if it is taken to suggest that there is
one set of methods which can, by itself, show that we have got the
‘right’ equations. He also argued that it is
misleading to think that the epistemology of simulation is cleanly
divided into an empirical part – verification – and a
mathematical (and computer science) part – namely, validation.
But this misleading idea often follows discussion of the two concepts
in the work of both philosophers and practitioners.

Philosophers have put this strong distinction between verification and
validation to work in arguments about the philosophical novelty of
computer simulations. As we saw in a previous section, Frigg and Reiss
(2009) argued that computer simulations could have no
epistemologically novel features, since they contained two distinct
components both of which had established epistemological frameworks to
them: one with questions related to conventional modeling –
e.g., do the computational models represent the target system
correctly? – and another in the realm of mathematics –
e.g., are the approximate solutions of computer simulations
close-enough to the actual (yet unavailable) solutions to be useful?
(ibid.)

Winsberg, however, argues that verification and validation are not so
cleanly separable. Most model equations chosen for simulation, for
example, are not in any straightforward sense “the right
equations”. They often reflect a compromise between what we
think best describes the phenomena and what is computationally
tractable. So, the equations that are chosen are rarely well
“validated” on their own. Furthermore, most methods of
validation by themselves are much too weak to establish the validity
of a simulation. Consequently, one point is that verification and
validation are not independent and separable activities. Another point
is that there are not two independent entities – one
mathematical and the other one empirical – onto which these
activities can be directed. Once one recognizes that the equations to
be “solved” are sometimes chosen so as to cancel
out discretization errors and other practical constraints (See Lenhard
2007 for an example involving the Arakawa operator), the distinction
between verification and validation gets harder to maintain. In such
instances, success is achieved in simulation with trial-and-error
piecemeal between model and method of calculation. Much like one
calibrates a recently designed instrument. When this happens, it is
hard even to know what it means to say that a simulation is separately
verified and validated. Frigg and Reiss’ argument against the
novelty of computer simulations, mentioned in
section 2.1,
fails in this very respect. Whether a solution provided by a computer
simulation is close-enough to actual but unavailable solutions to be
useful is not a “purely mathematical question” as they
suggest. Rather, it is a practical question and hence distinct from
the questions that arise in conventional modeling.

#### 2.3 Epistemic entitlements and other pragmatic approaches to the epistemology of computer simulations

A major strand of epistemology emphasizes that a proper account of
knowledge can accommodate the fact that we often rely, without
evidentiary justification, on our senses or the testimony of others.
According to philosophers such as Tyler Burge (1993; 1998), we have an
epistemic entitlement – i.e., a non-evidentiary,
non-justificatory epistemic warrant – to “rely, other
things equal” on these sources given that they underlie the
possibility of most of our conventional knowledge. Burge applies this
to his arguments on the epistemological foundations of
computer-assisted mathematical proofs (1998). Drawing partly from this
work, Barberousse and Vorms (2014) and later Beisbart (2017) deploy a
similar argumentative strategy to justify the use of computer
simulations and the trust we confer to their results. Computer
simulations are extremely complex – some of their argument go
– often the result of the epistemic labor of a diverse set of
scientist and other experts. As extensively documented, they are also
severely epistemically opaque (Humphreys 2004; 2009). Because of these
features, Beisbart argues, it is reasonable to treat computer
simulations in the same way we treat our senses or the testimony of
others: simply as things that can be trusted on the assumption that
they work (2017). Barberousse and Vorms, on their part, argue that we
can rely on the outputs of computer simulations the same way we can
– according to Burges’ style arguments – rely on
those of computer-assisted mathematical proofs: i.e., because there is
a chain of epistemic warrants, including entitlements, flowing from
the experts involved in their construction, the methods with which
simulations operate and the fundamental mathematical principles that
guide their functioning.

Symons and Alvarado (2019), however, argue that there are a couple of
problems with simply importing Burge’s arguments to the
epistemology of computer simulations. The first one is that, according
to Burge, computer assisted proofs are built in such a way that they
can be assumed to be transparent conveyors of epistemic
warrants. That is, when we ask what warrants justify our reliance on
the results of these computer-assisted proofs, we can answer that they
are the same kind of warrant that justifies our reliance on the output
of conventional mathematical operations. More precisely, if the
warrants that justify the outputs of mathematical operations are a
priori epistemic warrants – warrants whose source is prior to
experience or empirical examination – then the warrants that
justify the outputs of the operations carried out by the
computer-assisted proofs are the same or of the same kind, namely a
priori warrants. By contrast, a method or process is said to be a
non-transparent conveyor, if the methods or processes by
which we arrive at a result require or allow for a different kind of
warrant – in this case, an a posteriori kind of warrant –
to enter the pipeline.

Even accepting that this is indeed the case for computer-assisted
proofs – Symons and Alvarado, drawing in part from Ruphy (2015),
point to many of the properties of computer simulations in virtue of
which they fail to be transparent in Burge’ sense. This is
something also suggested by Lenhard and Küster (2019) as they
argue that there are many features of computer simulations that make
them difficult to reproduce and that therefore undermine some of the
stability that would be required for them to be transparent conveyors.
Vis-à-vis Beisbart’s position that that we can
argumentatively assume that computer simulations work well, Symons and
Alvarado suggest that there is compelling evidence to rather assume
the contrary and hence good reason to doubt that the processes
involved are reliable to begin with. Complex computer simulations,
Alvarado adds, “are novel, their aggregation is novel, or their
integration is novel”, and hence untested (2023, 26).

A second related issue here is that it remains unclear to what extent
technical artifacts can be said to inherit or preserve the epistemic
warrants behind the credentialed expertise of those involved in their
construction, or the methods underlying their functionalities. The
issue is even more pronounced when one considers a priori epistemic
warrants – such as the ones underlying formal methods or
abstract operations (e.g., in logic or mathematics) –
vis-à-vis a technical artifact. Trusting a technical artifact
that is designed to carry out mathematical operations, for example,
simply in virtue of the warrants that justify our reliance on
mathematics per se seems epistemically suspect. There are many
possibly defeating layers in between to simply trust one in virtue of
the other. We do not even do that with human mathematicians. That is,
we do not trust someone to do mathematics well simply because we trust
in the rules and principles of mathematics. Rather, we trust them on
their own independent and proven merits, i.e., through their own
warrants, which are often of the a posteriori kind: i.e., empirical
evidence of their abilities. When it comes to technical artifacts such
as computer simulations, this is more evidently the case, as Alvarado
notes: “computer simulations cannot count as transparent
conveyers given Burge’s characterization because justificatory
elements distinct from the ones warranting the original [mathematical]
content do in fact enhance, decrease or constitute the epistemic
warrants of the manipulated content [in their output].” (idem.,
124)

Hence, according to Symons and Alvarado, important epistemological
work must be done for the warrants that justify certain methodologies
to transfer as warrants to justify the use of and reliance on the
instruments these methodologies help build. In fact, it is not clear
that epistemic warrants can ever be transferred from one to the other.
Rather, computer simulations must have their own warrants and their
sanctioning process and the justification of our reliance on a given
simulation must be pursued independently from the sanctioning of the
methods that enable their construction. In short, just because we are
justified in trusting the experts that put simulations together and
the experts are justified in trusting the methods that enable them to
put these instruments together, does not mean that we get to
automatically justify our trust in the instruments themselves or their
results. Much empirical work remains to be done to do so. For these
reasons and others having to do with many of the features discussed in
previous sections, Symons and Alvarado argue that it is implausible
that we should appeal to epistemic entitlements as the epistemological
foundation behind our use of computer simulations.

Another approach to the epistemology of computer simulations –
which is not entirely based on epistemic entitlements but can also be
said to rely on a similar chain of trust, albeit with non-trivial
differences – is to ground their status in the
practical aspects of the craft of modeling and
simulation. According to this view, the best reasons we have for
believing the results of computer simulations have to do with our
trust in the practical skills and craft of the modelers that use them.
A good example of this kind of account is that of Hubig and Kaminski
(2017). The epistemological goal of this kind of work is to identify
the locus of our trust in simulations in practical aspects of the
craft of modeling and simulation, rather than in any features of the
models themselves. Under this view it is not the models or the
simulations that we trust, but the people and practices behind them.
Resch et al., (2017) for example, argue that a good part of the reason
we should trust simulations is not because of the simulations
themselves, but because of the interpretive artistry and skill of
those who employ them. Symons and Alvarado (2019) are also critical of
this approach, arguing that “part of the task of the
epistemology of computer simulation is to explain the difference
between the contemporary scientist’s position in relation to
epistemically opaque computer simulations” (p. 7) and the
relation of oracle believers to their oracles. Pragmatic and epistemic
considerations, according to Symons and Alvarado, co-exist, and they
are not possible competitors for the correct explanation of our trust
in simulations – epistemic reasons are ultimate what explain and
ground the pragmatic ones.

#### 2.4 Computer simulations and the epistemology of scientific instruments

Recently, Alvarado (2023) has suggested that many of the challenges
and questions regarding the epistemic role and import of computer
simulations in science so far examined could be best tackled if we
understood computer simulations as more closely related to scientific
instruments. Alvarado offers several arguments as to why the views
that understand computer simulations as either models or experiments
prove at best inadequate. He argues, for example, that computer
simulations are conceptually distinct from – i.e., non-identical
to – either the experiments for which they are deployed or the
models that they are designed to run. Computer simulations, Alvarado
argues, have distinct properties to models because they have to be
implemented and ran – as Parker (2003), Keller (2003), and
others suggests. In contrast, a model specified in a blueprint and
in-text specifications can be a model without having to be ran or
implemented. According to Alvarado, computer simulations are also
distinct from the contexts in which they are deployed (p. 58). While
it is true that, as Barberousse and Jebile (2019) suggest, computer
simulations can – through software/hardware implementation
– simulate full experimental specifications, the fact that they
can simulate such an endeavor already speaks to their distinct
functional character. In short, the fact that a simulation
can simulate such an experimental set-up speaks to the fact that it
does something distinct from both the set-up specifications, and from
what the experiment per se is trying to achieve. In this sense,
Alvarado argues, a computer simulation plays a more similar role to
that of a microscope or a telescope than to a complete experiment or
to a complete experimental design. Yet, unlike the latter, computer
simulations are also a hybrid instrument – one that must perform
to represent – much more like a measuring instrument such as an
analog thermometer.

Calling computer simulations an instrument is neither a nomenclature
strategy, nor a mere metaphorical device under this view. Although a
central target of Alvarado’s work is related to the
epistemological issues discussed above, he sees these epistemological
repercussions as a product of an ontological commitment to the nature
of computer simulations (p. 148). Although important work has been
done in the philosophy of technology regarding both the nature and the
role of instruments in science (See for example, Koyré (1957);
Kroes and Meijer 2002b; Heidelberger 2003), the epistemology of
scientific instruments has been, for the most part, ignored by
philosophers of science – with only a few notable exceptions
(see Hacking (1983), Baird (2004), Fox-Keller (2003), or more recently
Russo (2023)). Given this fact and the recency of this approach,
either objections and/or additions to this strain of thought on
computer simulations have not yet fully played out.

#### 2.5 Epistemic Opacity and Computational Reliabilism

It is now accepted by both practitioners and philosophers that
computer simulations are, as Humphreys (2004) suggests, epistemically
opaque. That is, they are not immediately amenable to thorough
inspection, error correction and/or even conventional notions of
understanding and explanation (Kaminski et al. 2018; Symons and
Alvarado 2016).

Broadly, the term epistemic opacity refers to the lack of access that
an inquiring agent may have to the relevant aspects by which a process
achieves whatever task it is supposed to achieve. In other words, an
epistemically opaque process is one whose significant details about
its functioning – or, importantly, its failing to do so
(Alvarado 2025) – are not available to someone seeking to
understand it, make use of it, or to someone who is subject to the
results emerging from the fulfillment of its task.

Humphreys succinctly defines epistemic opacity the following way:

A process is epistemically opaque relative to a cognitive agent
X at time t just in case X does not know at
t all of the epistemically relevant elements of the process.
(2009, 618)

As can be noted, it is a general and relative account of epistemic
opacity as it is relative to a specific agent and the agent’s
circumstances at a specific time (Humphreys 2004; Alvarado 2020) We
can, for example imagine many processes to be epistemically opaque in
this way to many people at many times: the processes in your computer,
the processes by which books are bound, etc., can all be opaque to
some of us at any given point. Furthermore, as Alvarado (2021)
suggests, “pointing to something as being epistemically opaque
in the manner defined above does not provide any interesting and/or
peculiar information about the system in relation to anything else.
This is particularly the case if what one is trying to understand and
say something about is a specific piece of technology.”

Anticipating the latter objection, however, Humphreys suggested
computer simulations are not just epistemically opaque. They are
essentially so (2009). A process (system, device or method),
according to Humphreys, is essentially opaque to an epistemic agent if
it is impossible, in virtue of their own nature, for them to know the
epistemically relevant elements of a system or process. Importantly,
essential opacity is not just a stronger version of the general
opacity described above. Rather, it is a different kind of opacity.
According to Alvarado, this is made clear by two main factors: the
first one is that it is the kind of opacity that arises in virtue
of the agent’s nature and not in virtue of something else,
say an agent’s environmental circumstances or a specific time t.
And second, given that it is relative to an agent’s nature, it
is the kind of epistemic obstacle that is insurmountable not just for
an agent A but for any agent of the same nature. This fact often,
though certainly not always, suggest that many of the technical
aspects and processes involved in computer simulation may not be
opaque because of “sloppy modeling” or because these
processes are “poorly understood”, rather they can be
opaque simply “because [the processes themselves] are
complex” (Saam 2017, 80). Both are often neglected in the
epistemology of computer simulations.

Sophisticated views that understand the severity of Humphreys’
challenge and the implications of this obstacle for an epistemology of
computer simulations (or computational methods in general)
nevertheless still need to make sense of our undeniable reliance and
our successful deployment of computer simulations in scientific
inquiry. Yet, if it is the case that computer simulations are indeed
black boxes in this severe sense, i.e., if their relevant epistemic
details are inaccessible in an insurmountable manner, then it is
unclear how one can go about sanctioning them as reliable. The
situation is made even worse if one seriously considers the challenges
to widespread verification and validation techniques posed by Symons
and Horner (2014). Symons and Horner suggest that conventional error
assessment techniques used in science to characterize the reliability
of a system or procedure are inadequate to deal with what they call
software-intensive science – scientific inquiry in which
computational methods play an indispensable role. The main challenge,
they write, is that:

the kinds of errors associated with contemporary scientific practice
stand in sharp contrast with those found in traditional science. In a
scientific domain that contains no software, we can at least partially
characterize the distribution of errors in terms of [conventional
statistical inference theory]. CSIT, of course, has long been a
concern of epistemology of science. To the extent that software
systems play an essential role in contemporary science, we cannot be
assured that CSIT can be used to characterize the distribution of
error. This is because the languages used in software systems that are
essential to the practice of science admit a kind of conditionality
that cannot be captured using CSIT. Without CSIT to help characterize
the distribution of errors in software systems used in inquiry, there
is no effective procedure for characterizing those distributions
except by testing every path. Testing all paths in a typical software
system containing more than 108 paths [as most software
systems used in science do] is intractable. (2014, 474)

Although it is certainly unclear whether or not the indispensability
of computer simulations is the as severe as more fundamental software
(Krämer et al. 2024), one possible strategy to address the
challenge of epistemic opacity when it occurs at any level is to go
back to Humphreys’ original definition and attempt to clarify
what the “epistemically relevant elements” of a process
are and exactly what it is that we need to know about a system or
process in order to deem it reliable. One possible answer to this is
that we may not need to know that much. As we will see in the next
section, Durán and Formanek (2018) – in a view they call
computational reliabilism – suggest that we may not need to know
any internal features of a system to assess its
reliability.

##### 2.5.1 Computational reliabilism

Roughly, computational reliabilism is the view that in the context of
computational methods researchers are justified in believing or
trusting the results yielded by such methods “because there is a
reliable process (i.e. the algorithm) that yields, most of the time,
trustworthy results.” (Durán and Jongsma 2021, 332)

According to Durán and Formanek, computational reliabilism
stems from key concepts in Alvin Goldman’s process
reliabilism, which suggests that an inference/assertion can be
accepted if it is the product of a reliable process. According to
these views, however, a reliable assertion need not include details
about the reliable processes that produced it. The reliability in
question is that of the assertion, or the output of a process, and not
that of the processes by which it was produced, or so it is argued.
Following from this, a process can be reliable even if the reasons
why it is reliable are not accessible to an agent
(Comesaña 2010, 571).

In particular, those championing such a framework suggest that
computational reliabilism can circumvent the challenges related to
epistemic opacity in computational methods, can warrant or justify our
beliefs regarding the reliability of computational processes and their
results, and can also reassure us of the possibility of trust in
computational methods, practices and artifacts even if these are
insurmountably opaque.

Durán and Formanek accept views of reliability that suggest
that users and practitioners of computer simulations are justified in
trusting their results because they can “trust the assumptions
upon which they are built” (2018, 652), as suggested by Beisbart
(2017) and others. Nevertheless, they also suggest that computational
reliabilism does not need these assumptions. Rather, they argue, their
view takes into consideration ‘reliability indicators’
that are “markers of methodological and epistemological
competence of the computer, algorithms and social processes involved
in the formation of beliefs.” (Durán 2024). Because of
this, Durán and Formanek suggest that, unlike conventional
reliabilism theories in epistemology, computational reliabilism
involves a retrospective reliability chain, which, according
to them, “conditions the sources that attribute reliability to
[computational methods] to be reliable in and by themselves.”
Furthermore, such sources, they accept, “must be shown
to be reliable.” (2018, 656 italics mine). Computer simulations,
so their argument goes, can be deemed reliable via factors –
external to the algorithms themselves – that function as
reliability indicators. These include “identifying methods
(formal or otherwise), metrics, expert competencies, cultures of
research, and the like that make up for our best epistemic and
normative efforts that might increase the degree of warrant we have to
believe the outputs” of these systems.

The important argumentative strategy here is to emphasize that the
factors in consideration can be external to the processes under
question, without any internal factors considered. Thus, computational
reliabilism can overcome the challenge posed by epistemic opacity,
even when accepting the severe version suggested by Humphreys (2009)
and others. In this sense, Durán and Formanek argue, the
reliability of computer simulations can be understood by considering
their tendency to produce “high proportion of true beliefs
relative to false ones.” (ibid., 653) Trusting the results of
computer simulations therefore, according to this view, “depends
on a chain of reliable processes that, in the end, allow researchers
to be justified in believing the results” (p. 655) This is
something echoed in Ferrario’s (2023) approach to their own,
highly formalized, version of reliabilism. Where this chain ends,
however, is simply left unanswered (Durán and Formanek 2018,
fn.6 p.655). This last point seeks to make the reliability chain
referred to by Durán and Formanek somewhat distinct from the
simple appeal to a chain of epistemic entitlements criticized by
Symons and Alvarado (2019). That it is so, however, remains
unclear.

It is worth noting, at this point, that if the argument from
computational reliabilism is asking us to only consider the rate of
success of a process, this must be leveraged by an error assessment
that deploys CSIT – e.g., an assessment about the error rate, or
distribution of error through sampling code lines. If we take Symons
and Horner’s point seriously – that error in software is
not randomly distributed – then, as they argue, CSIT may prove
inadequate for error assessment to begin with. If so, it is unclear
that computational reliabilism can even count on the exogenous
features of a process that conventional reliabilism opens the door to.
Along the same lines, Alvarado (2025), further suggests that when it
comes to technical artifacts and their reliability,
endogenous features such as the nature and source of error
are an indispensable element of reliability assessments. Furthermore,
opacity, he argues, in these contexts matters most when an agent is
attempting to know how something fails and not just how something
works. Together, these two considerations and the obstacles elucidated
by Humphreys and by Symons and Horner, make it so that the viability
of computational reliablism as an epistemological framework for
computer simulations in science may need further defense than what has
been offered so far by its proponents.

### 3. Other issues related to computer simulations in science

The advent and now ubiquity of computer simulations in scientific
inquiry has ramifications across multiple dimensions in the philosophy
of science. The following section offers a brief survey of some of
these considerations.

#### 3.1 Scientific theories and computer simulations

In his book Extending Ourselves (2004), Paul Humphreys argued that
computer simulations have profound implications for our understanding
of the structure of theories. He argued that computer simulations
reveal inadequacies with both the semantic and the syntactic views of
scientific theories. Computer simulations illustrate two things: that
both the syntactic view of scientific theories – which implied
that modeling played, if anything, only a heuristic role in science
and had nothing to do with theory and that logical deduction was a
useful regulative idea for thinking about how inferences from theory
to the world are drawn – and the semantic view – which
emphasized an important role for models but also urged that theories
were non-linguistic entities and urged philosophers not to be
distracted by the contingencies of linguistic expressions associated
to theorizing – were misguided. Computer simulations, for
example, seem to show that there are methods of theory application
that vastly outstrip the inferential power of logical deduction, and
hence that it was profoundly wrong to think that logical deduction was
the right tool for rationally reconstructing the process of theory
application. On the flip side, computer simulations seem to also
reveal that, as Humphreys urged, syntax matters. It was wrong, it
turns out, to suggest, as the semantic view did, that the particular
linguistic form in which a scientific theory is expressed is
philosophically uninteresting. As Humphreys put it: “the
specific syntactic representation used is often crucial to the
solvability of the theory’s equations” (2009, 620).

Another issue of philosophical interest in discussions about the
epistemic import of computer simulations was that of emergence in
complex systems. Humphreys (2004) and Bedau (2011), have argued that
philosophers interested in the topics of emergence can learn a great
deal by looking at computer simulation. In particular, Bedau argues,
that even if simulation does not say much about strong emergence which
has been the main focus of philosophers – and which posits brute
downward causation that is irreducible in principle – it can
nevertheless elucidate features of a weak emergence – one that
allows for the reducibility of wholes to parts in principle, but not
in practice. Systems that produce weak emergent properties are mere
mechanisms, but the mechanisms are very complex (they have many
independently interacting parts). As a result, there is no way to
figure out exactly what will happen given a specific set of initial
and boundary conditions, except to “crawl the causal web”.
Weakly emergent properties are characteristic of complex systems in
nature. And it is also characteristic of complex computer simulations
that there is no way to predict what they will do except to let them
run. It is here that the connection to computer simulation arises.
Weak emergence explains, according to Bedau, why computer simulations
play a central role in the science of complex systems. The best way to
understand and predict how real complex systems behave is to simulate
them by crawling the micro-causal web and see what happens.

More recently, there has been a resurgence in the representational
aspect of computer simulations and their relation to modeling. Models
of course involve idealization. But it has been argued that some kinds
of idealization, which play an especially prominent role in the kinds
of modeling involved in computer simulation, are special – to
the point that they deserve the title of fiction. Winsberg (2009c) has
argued that fiction does have a special connection to computer
simulations. Or rather, that some computer simulations contain
elements that best typify what we might call fictional representations
in science, even if those representations are not uniquely present in
simulations. These kinds of fictional components – useful guides
to the way the world is in some general sense, without necessarily
pointing to a certain part of the world in particular – of
models are paradigmatically exemplified in certain computer
simulations. Two of his examples are the “silogen atom”
and “artificial viscosity”. Silogen atoms are a fiction in
Winsberg’s sense, but they are used so that the overall model
can be hoped to get things right. Thus, the overall model is not a
fiction, but one of its components is. Similarly, artificial viscosity
is a technique that pretends that a fluid is highly viscous – a
fiction. Again, the overall model involved in these practices is not a
fiction. But the component called artificial viscosity is.

Winsberg’s account of fictions and their role in computer
simulations has drawn some criticism. Toon (2010) has argued that this
definition of a fiction is too narrow. Toon, presumably, supports a
broader conception of the role of fictions in science according to
which they do not play a particular heightened role in computer
simulations. (For a thorough analysis of the role of idealization and
fiction in modeling and simulation see Pincock 2011; For a thorough
argument about a diminished epistemic role that fictions play in
genuine scientific explanations see Sullivan and Khalifa 2019).

#### 3.2 The Ontology of Simulation Content

Permeating the many discussions above, a question persists regarding
the content of the inferences and assertions we derive from computer
simulations. What exactly are we referring to when we say or infer
propositions about entities in a simulation, such as “the
particles attract” or “galaxy clusters swerve”,
etc.? Most of these – particles, predators, agents, etc. –
are simply numerical constructs coded so that their dynamic
transformations are visualized in a display. Although one could
understand the propositions above to be simply manners of speech,
there is a sense in which we do mean what we say about these
representational entities. That is, it is either true or false of the
simulated particles that they attract or not. Note that this is the
case whether or not these entities are standing in place for some
real-world target. We may for example say that “these
particles attract” when the simulated particles either do not
represent actual physical particles, or when physical particles do not
show the same behavior. If so, what exactly are we talking
about in these instances? For these sentences to make sense,
perhaps we must articulate, in ontological terms, what these entities
are.

As an answer to these challenges, some philosophers have suggested
that in such instances we are dealing with digital artifacts
(Beisbart 2019; Chalmers 2019) – computerized objects designed,
developed, and deployed for a specific function. Beisbart (2024),
however, contests this view. In particular, Beisbart suggests that
there are two senses in which there is an under-determination problem
in simulation ontologies. The first one is that the choice of entities
can differ arbitrarily in a simulation. The second issue is that the
same mathematical structures are used for distinct phenomena in
different simulations. In his words “computer simulations can be
described at different levels, and the highest level, where the
simulation is described using representations, is not completely fixed
by the underlying computational layer.” Furthermore, he adds,
“the same computations may be used for different purposes, and
various objects can be read into them. Further, although the purposes
or intentions of users can, in principle, help to determine the
simulated objects, they often do not suffice to fix objects
uniquely.” (Beisbart 2024 p)

According to this view, we need not be committed to any digital
entity. Rather, we can deal with these assertions in the same way we
deal with other fictional constructions. If we do, he argues,
“we do not need any simulated objects in our ontology to make
sense of related talk. Under this account, simulated objects are
superfluous. Given that the postulation of simulated objects led to
problems, it seems better to do without them.” (Beisbart
2024)

Although this deflationary view may be appealing for pragmatic
concerns in the philosophy of science, the ontological nature of
simulated phenomena is a serious and interesting philosophical in and
of itself. It is a problem that relates to issues in the emergence of
phenomena in both simple and complex simulations such as cellular
automata. One example is in trying to make sense of gliders –
spatiotemporal cluster dynamics that appear to advance through a grid
in a cohesive manner giving the impression of coordinated or
continuous or interdependent movement from one step, or iteration, to
the next – in computational experiments such as Conway’s
“game of life.” (Seager 2012; Symons 2015).

#### 3.3 Formal Relations

While the issues surrounding the relationship between representational
devices and their target, which also affect computer simulations, are
many and varied, there are still attempts at formulating an account of
such relationships such that it captures some sort of analogy or
similarity amongst the models involved in simulation and their target
systems.

Winsberg, for example, writes that a “simulation is any system
that is believed, or hoped, to have dynamical behavior that is
similar enough to some other system such that the former can
be studied to learn about the other.” (2020, italics ours) What
this similarity entails, however, is a topic of profound philosophical
debate, since the issue affects not just questions about computer
simulations but any representational device (See Weisberg 2013;
Pincock 2011).

These relations can be formulated in terms of identity and dependence
(as we saw in our discussion of experiments and computer simulations),
isomorphisms of various sorts and at various levels, analogy and
similarity, etc. When it comes to computer simulations however,
Primiero (2020) suggests that a formal description of this
relationship that incorporates all these considerations (e.g.,
similarity and dependence relationships) can nevertheless be achieved.
This is because if we assume that a relation indeed exists between the
formal characterization of a target phenomena and the algorithmic
processes engineered to simulate them, this relationship can be found
by looking at the mathematical elements, operations and structures
therein. He identifies two candidate principles to guide the
formulation of such a formal relationship:

Weak simulationist principle: if a physical system is
exactly simulated by a computation, then that type of computation is
all there is to the nature of the physical system.

Strong simulationist principle: every physical system
can be simulated by a physical computation.

For a full overview of how these principles play out in terms of
formal mathematical structures involved in algorithmic simulation
processes see Primiero (2020, 241–254)

#### 3.4 Computer simulations and policy

In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic response, the
unprecedented use of computer simulations for decision-making in
policy became evident. In a video titled “Moral Models”,
Winsberg characterizes the magnitude and the unprecedented nature of
this reliance on computer simulations by policy-makers the following
way:

This is probably the episode in human history in which computer
modeling has affected the course of human events more than ever before
[…] The degree to which this [technology] took center stage in
decision-making was the main way in which [usage of computer models]
was unprecedented. (Harvard et al. 2022, minute: 02:00)

Issues surrounding the epistemic challenges, and their associated
social risks, in this context have been discussed at length by Harvard
and Winsberg (2021), Harvard et al., (2021), as well as by Winsberg
and Harvard (2022) and Harvard and Winsberg (2022; 2024). In short,
Harvard et al., have brought to the fore the social, ethical, and
normative challenges posed by the deployment of and reliance on
computer simulation models by policy-makers in the context of the fact
that simulations are not always adequate for the purposes to which
policy-makers want to use them. In particular, they highlight the
degree to which the role that assumptions, idealizations, and choices
regarding what to represent in a model and what to ignore, make the
building of simulations that guide policy a highly value-laden
enterprise. They also discuss the degree to which builders of models
and simulations that guide policy have a “moral-epistemic
duty” to give consideration to the values held by relevant
stake-holders and the public generally.

Some of the considerations brought forth by Winsberg and Harvard and
colleagues about modeling in epidemiology and climate science have
been echoed in relation to other disciplines. An important part of the
framework surrounding the discourse on moral models –
besides highlighting the unavoidable moral dimension embedded in these
seemingly neutral formal methods – is to highlight the role of
both the interest of those doing the modeling, and their corresponding
limitations regarding the interest of those unlike them (vis-a-vis
socioeconomic class, inalienability of labor contexts, etc.). For a
brief overview of some of these considerations in contexts such as
healthcare please see Durán and van den Hoven, ed., (2022)
The Societal and Ethical Dimensions of Computer Simulations.
In this volume, Bak (2022), for example, suggests that there are
serious considerations regarding fairness when it comes to modeling
the distribution of healthcare resources. In particular, Bak argues
that there is no consensus on which a theory of justice should
underlie choices in the models simulating the distribution of things
like cardiac defibrillators and other public health resources and that
modelers lack the heuristic resources to build equity considerations
into their simulation models. A more thorough overview of the
epistemic and ethical considerations of modeling, particularly in the
context of climate simulations, comes from the work of Kawamleh,
(2022; 2023).

This conversation regarding the over-reliance on simulation models for
policy making in the second decade of the 21st century
mirrors a similar debate that arose in the Netherlands at the start of
the century when the epistemic status of computer simulations in the
context of climate change was debated by practitioners, philosophers,
and policy-makers (Petersen 2012). In this context, the use of
computer simulations was publicly questioned by a whistleblower
researcher arguing that the government’s annual report on the
state of the environment had no realistic value since most of the
results used for policymaking had been derived from computer
simulations alone (Petersen 2012). Others, such as Petersen (2012),
however, considered that in this context, as discussed in previous
sections, computer simulations proved to be more reliable than
conventional evidence available. This last point was anticipated by
Paul Humphreys (2004) when he said that machines, and by extensions
computational methods, do whatever they are deployed to do better than
we could and that this is why we use them in the first place.
Nevertheless, as elucidated by Winsberg and others, that this is the
case is not immediately obvious, particularly when we consider a
complex technical artifact that involves input and maintenance from a
motely set of practitioners whose methods and norms are either not yet
established, or, as Symons and Alvarado (2022) argue, are not
transparent conveyers.

#### 3.5 Trust and Computer Simulations

As can be gathered, a looming overarching issue in much of the
literature has to do with our ability trust computer simulations.
When, how, and why we trust them, could trust them, or should trust
them are questions that continue to this date. Some take it that the
role of the epistemologist of computer simulations in science is to
make sense of the fact that engineers, practitioners, and scientist
do trust them (Duran and Formanek 2018). Others think that
the responsibility of the philosopher is to provide an appropriate
framework to underlie this trust. And yet other philosophers suggest
that – given either the state of the arts or the intrinsic
properties of simulations – we cannot appropriately trust them
and, hence, we simply should not trust them (Symons and Alvarado
2019).

More recently, however, literature has emerged suggesting that we
ought to pay attention to the fact that there are distinct kinds of
trust and distinct ways in which they can be appropriately conferred.
Alvarado (2023b) suggests, for example, that epistemic
technologies such as computer simulations should only be
allocated epistemic trust – a trust that is allocated
exclusively in virtue of epistemic reasons, as opposed to practical or
axiological ones – if and when they are proven trustworthy. Boge
(2024) on the other hand provides a more nuanced set of distinctions
regarding distinct kinds of trust by distinguishing between the
expected epistemic role that computer simulations play in different
experimental setting. Like Alvarado, Boge suggests this allocation of
trust is best understood by “distinguishing different epistemic
capacities of simulations and different senses of trust”. This
results in “trusting simulations in their capacity to facilitate
credible experimental results can mean accepting them as means for
generating belief in these results, while this need not imply
believing the models themselves in their capacity to represent an
underlying reality.” (ibid.)

Whether or not Boge’s last point above holds or whether his
distinction can overcome the challenges posed to reliabilist accounts
surveyed here or the challenges posed by Symons and Alvarado leveraged
against epistemic entitlements is not yet clear.
