Abstract
With recent Nobel Prizes recognising AI contributions to science, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are transforming scientific research by enhancing productivity and reshaping the
scientific method. LLMs are now involved in experimental design, data analysis, and
workflows, particularly in chemistry and biology. However, challenges such as
hallucinations and reliability persist.
In this contribution, we review how Large Language Models (LLMs) are redefining the
scientific method and explore their potential applications across different stages of the
scientific cycle, from hypothesis testing to discovery. We conclude that, for LLMs to serve
as relevant and effective creative engines and productivity enhancers, their deep integration
into all steps of the scientific process should be pursued in collaboration and alignment
with human scientific goals, with clear evaluation metrics.
The transition to AI-driven science raises ethical questions about creativity, oversight, and
responsibility. With careful guidance, LLMs could evolve into creative engines, driving
transformative breakthroughs across scientific disciplines responsibly and effectively.
However, the scientific community must also decide how much it leaves to LLMs to drive
science, even when associations with ‘reasoning’, mostly currently undeserved, are made
in exchange for the potential to explore hypothesis and solution regions that might
otherwise remain unexplored by human exploration alone.

Introduction
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed multiple areas of society,
the world economy, and academic and scientific practice. Generative AI and Large
Language Models (LLMs) present unprecedented opportunities to transform scientific
practice, advance Science, and accelerate technological innovation. Nobel Prizes in
Physics and Chemistry were awarded to several AI leaders for their contributions to AI
and frontier models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). This promises to transform
or contribute to scientific research by enhancing productivity and supporting various stages
of the scientific method. The use of AI in science is booming across numerous scientific
areas and is impacting different parts of the scientific method.
Despite the potential of LLMs for hypothesis generation and data synthesis, AI and
LLMs face challenges in fundamental science and scientific discovery. Hence, our premise
in our perspective is that AI, in general, has so far been limited in its impact on fundamental
science, which is defined here as the discovery of new principles or new scientific laws.
Here, we review how LLMs are currently used – as a technological tool – to augment the
scientific process in practice and how they may be used in the future as they become more
powerful tools and develop into powerful scientific assistants. Combining data-driven
techniques with symbolic systems, such a system could fuse into hybrid engines that may
lead to novel research directions. We aim to describe the gap between LLMs as technical
tools and “creative engines” that could enable new high-quality scientific discoveries and
pose novel questions and hypotheses to human scientists. We first review the current use
of LLMs in Science, aiming to identify limitations that need to be addressed when moving
toward creative engines.
There is solid recognition and excitement for the transformative potential of AI in
Science. For example, leading machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML) have
recently (2021-2023) arranged targeted workshops on AI4Science. Some recent reviews
and papers include1–38. This demonstrates the energy and potential of using automated (i.e.,
AI tools) for Science. This “dream” can be traced back to the times of Turing and the
emergence of Artificial Intelligence in the 1950s39. With recent advancements in
computational techniques, vastly increased production of scientific data, and the rapid
evolution of machine learning, this long-held vision can be transformed into reality. Yet,

3

most current reviews and original papers focus on specifically designed machine learning
architectures targeting particular application domains or problems.
For example, recent reviews have explored how to use variants of Deep Learning,
Geometric Deep Learning, or Generative AI in its generality (including different
architectures such as CNNs, GNNs, GANs, diffusion models, VAEs, and Transformers) as
a tool for assisting Science 3,11,13,15,19,22. For example, Wang et al.1, reviews breakthroughs
in how specific techniques such as geometric deep learning, self-supervised learning,
neural operators, and language modelling have augmented Science in protein folding,
nuclear fusion, and drug discovery. An essential thread in their review is the vital notion
of representation, pointing out that different AI architectures can support valuable
representations of scientific data and thereby augment Science. Recent papers demonstrate
the appeal and the potential of using AI-driven and augmented tools for automating
science1,4,13,40. Traditional scientific advancements have been primarily driven by
hypothesis-led experimentation and theoretical development, often limited by human
cognitive capacities and manual data processing. For example, the formulation of
Newtonian mechanics required meticulous observation and mathematical formalization
over extended periods. Here, the rise of AI4Science represents a paradigmatic revolution
that could reach beyond human cognitive limitations. AI-driven advancements promise to
enable rapid processing and analysis of massive data sets, revealing complex patterns that
surpass human analytical capabilities. For example, DeepMind's AlphaFold dramatically
transformed protein structure prediction, a longstanding scientific challenge, using deep
learning to predict protein folding accurately. Furthermore, AI4Science could reverse the
slowdown in scientific productivity in recent years, where literature search and peer-review
evaluation41–43 are bottlenecks.
In contrast to previous reviews, here we first address the use of LLMs, regardless
of the specific underlying architecture, and their use as a tool for the scientific process. We
assess how different areas of science use LLMs in their respective scientific process. This
analysis sets the stage for asking how LLMs can synthesize information, generate new
ideas and hypotheses, guide the scientific method, and augment fundamental scientific
discoveries. Here, we ask to what extent AI can be described as a “general method of
invention,” which could open up new paradigms and directions of scientific investigations.

4

Hence, complementary to a purely representational and architectural viewpoint of
AI4Science, we find it constructive to ask and assess to what extent the nature of the
scientific process, both its inductive and deductive components, can and should be
transformed by AI techniques.

Current use of LLMs – From Specialised Scientific Copilots to LLMassisted Scientific Discoveries
The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and generate human-like text,
handle vast amounts of data, and analyse complex patterns with potentially some reasoning
capabilities has increasingly set the stage for them to be used in scientific research across
various disciplines. Their applications range from simple tasks, such as acting as copilots
to assist scientists, to complex tasks, such as autonomously performing experiments and
proposing novel hypotheses. We will first introduce the fundamental concepts of LLMs
and then review their various applications in scientific discovery.
Prompting LLMs: From Chatbot to Prompt Engineering
Current mainstream LLMs are primarily conditional generative models, where the input,
such as the beginning of a sentence or instructions, serves as a condition, and the output is
the generated text, such as a reply. This text is typically sampled auto-regressively: the next
token (considered the building block of words) is sampled from a predicted distribution.
See Figure 1A.

5

Figure 1: (A) LLMs generate sentences in an auto-regressive manner, sampling tokens
from a predicted distribution at each step. (B) A typical prompt for LLMs consists of a
system prompt and a user prompt. The LLM will then respond as an assistant. A multiround dialogue will repeat the user and assistant contents. (C) LLM agents are systems that
use a large language model as its core reasoning and decision-making engine, enabling it
to interpret instructions, plan actions, and autonomously interact with external tools,
environments, or other LLM agents to fulfil a given goal.
Given LLMs' capabilities in computation and emerging potential for reasoning, which we
define as the ability to solve tasks that require reasoning, they can be considered
programming languages that use human language as the code that instructs them to perform
desired tasks. This code takes the form of “prompts.” For instruct-tuned LLMs, the prompt
often consists of three parts: the system prompt and the user prompt, with an LLM's reply
considered the assistant prompt. Hence, a chat is frequently composed of
<system><user><assistant><user><assistant>, see Figure 1B. The system prompt
typically includes general instructions for the LLMs, such as behaviour, meta-information,
format, etc. The user prompt usually contains detailed instructions and questions. Using
these prompts, the LLMs generate replies under the role of “assistant.
Since LLMs do not have background knowledge about the user, and prompts are
their major input, designing a good prompt is often critical to achieving the desired output
and superior performance. Researchers have shown that specific prompts, including
accuracy, creativity, and reasoning, can significantly improve output performance.
6

Specifically, the chain-of-thought (CoT) method44 can instruct LLMs to think step-by-step,
leading to better results. Beyond these, the Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)
method45 can incorporate a large amount of context by indexing the contents and retrieving
relevant materials, then combining the retrieved information with prompts to generate the
output. Due to the importance of prompts and LLM agents, designing prompts is now often
called “prompt engineering,” and many techniques and tricks have been developed in this
area46,47, such as asking JSON format outputs, formulating clear instructions, setting
temperatures, etc47,48.
While carefully designed prompts can accomplish many tasks, they are not robust
and reliable enough for complex tasks requiring multiple steps or non-language
computations, nor can they explore autonomously. LLM agents are developed for these
requirements, especially for complex tasks. LLM agents are autonomous systems powered
by LLMs, which can actively seek to observe environments, make decisions, and perform
actions using external tools49. In many cases, we need to ensure reliability, achieve highperformance levels, enable automation, or process large amounts of context. These tasks
cannot be accomplished solely with LLMs and require integrating LLMs into agent
systems. Early examples include AutoGPT50 and BabyAGI51, where LLMs are treated as
essential tools within the agent system (Figure 1C). In scientific discovery, LLM agents
become even more critical due to the complexity of science and its high-performance
requirements. Many tools have also been developed to provide easy access to these
prompting and agent methods, such as LangChain52 and LlamaIndex53. Automated prompt
design methods, such as DSPy54 and TextGrad55, are also being developed to design
prompts and LLM agents in a data-driven way.
LLMs as Practical Scientific Copilots
The ability of LLMs to work with a large body of text is being exploited in the practice of
science. For example, LLMs assist in proposing novel ideas, writing scientific papers and
generating computer code, thereby improving productivity; they also adapt texts for diverse
audiences ranging from experts to broader audiences, thus supporting communication in
science.

7

Furthermore, LLMs can sift through vast bodies of scientific literature to identify
relevant papers, findings, and trends. Such reviewing of the relevant literature helps
investigators quickly digest and identify gaps in enormous bodies of scientific knowledge.
These capabilities can also mitigate discursive barriers across different scientific fields,
supporting interdisciplinary scientific collaborations and knowledge sharing. Recently,
chatbots have emerged in several disciplines as virtual assistants answering scientific
queries posed by scientists. Such tools exploit the power of LLMs to extract and detect
patterns, data, and knowledge. These techniques may also serve as important tools in
science education and communication.
These examples demonstrate the rise of LLMs in extracting and sharing information
and the exciting open research frontier of the potential of reasoning that they represent in
different scientific domains56–58. For instance, Caufield et al. proposed the SPIRES
method59, which uses LLMs to extract structured data from the literature. Beyond data
extraction, LLMs have also shown evidence of outperforming annotation tasks60,61,
enabling scientists to scale data annotation. Some domain-specific models also show
superior performance in classification, annotation, and prediction tasks62–64. With the help
of RAG methods45, LLMs can directly apply their information extraction and distillation
capabilities to large amounts of text data. With the combination of diverse capabilities of
LLMs interconnected through LLM-agents, the recent “AI co-scientist65” demonstrates
impressive ability in generating novel research ideas by leveraging existing literature,
engaging in internal LLM-agent debates, and refining its outputs. This process leads to
constructive progress when applied to real scientific tasks.
Moreover, LLMs are currently used to automate the experimental design and the
execution of experiments. For example, Boiko, et al.66 propose an autonomous LLM
capable of performing chemical experiments. This work employs an LLM planner to
manage the experimental process, such as drawing patterns on plates or conducting more
complex chemical syntheses. Compared to hard-coded planners, the LLM-based planner is
more flexible and can handle unexpected situations. Similar kinds of loop and tool usage
are also shown in67, which includes literature tools, consulting with humans, experimental
tools, and safety tools.

8

In the biological domain, for instance, the CRISPR-GPT68 represents a significant
advancement in biological research. It utilizes LLMs to automate the design of gene-editing
experiments, enhancing both the efficiency and precision of genetic modifications, which
is pivotal in speeding up genomic research and applications. Another advance in the
application of LLMs in the biological domain is BioDiscoveryAgent69. These tools
augment scientists’ capabilities and accelerate scientific discovery.
The capabilities described thus far capture the current use of LLMs as knowledge
engines.

Summarising, extracting, interfacing, and reasoning about (scientific) text,

alongside automating experimental design and execution. While immensely useful, it
remains an open frontier on how to do this safely and efficiently. It largely depends on how
prompting is performed and how LLM agent systems are designed.
Foundation Models for Science
A key observation when using LLMs as clever text engines or exploiting the underlying
machine learning (neural) architecture for solving specific scientific problems was the
importance of scale. Larger models trained on larger amounts of data, or spending larger
amounts of computation during inference time yielded an increase in performance56,70,71.
The discovery of such scaling laws72 demonstrated that LLMs’ performance improves as
the number of parameters increases. Thus, we can expect the above trends to grow in
importance as these systems are trained on ever larger amounts of data. Emergent
behaviours, such as reasoning were suggested when models increased in scale73.
Concurrent with the appreciation of scaling laws came the realisation that instead of using
LLMs for specialised problems or as text engines, one could potentially train them on large
amounts of data, not necessarily text, but different modalities of scientific data. This is the
idea of a foundation model. These are large-scale pre-trained models that, when trained
with a sufficient amount of data of different types, such models “learn” or “encapsulate”
knowledge of a large scientific domain, thus reaching beyond a specific scientific problem.
When fine-tuned to particular tasks, such models can solve a wide range of downstream
tasks. The notion of foundation models refers to their generality in that they can be adapted
to many different applications, unlike task-specific engineered models solving a
specialised task such as protein folding. Notably, the famous transformer architecture that

9

fuels LLMs has become the architecture of choice when constructing the foundational
models in different domains of science. These self-supervised models are usually pretrained on extensive and diverse datasets. This enables them to learn from massive
unlabelled data since masking parts of the data and then requiring the model to predict the
occluded parts provides foundation models with their learning objective. This technique is
used when training LLMs on large amounts of text. The idea is thus exploited in scientific
domains where multi-modal data is used to train self-supervised foundation models. Once
trained, the model can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks without requiring
additional training. Consequently, the same model can be applied to a wide range of
downstream tasks. The foundation model encapsulates a large body of scientific
“knowledge” inherent in the training data.
Leveraging these ideas, there has been a rise in the number of foundation models
of science. For example, the Evo and Evo 2 models enable prediction and generation tasks
from the molecular to the genome scale74. While Evo is trained on millions of prokaryotic
and phage genomes, Evo 275 includes massive eukaryotic genomes, and both demonstrate
zero-shot function prediction across DNA, RNA, and protein modalities. It excels at
multimodal generation tasks, as shown by generating synthetic CRISPR-Cas molecular
complexes and transposable systems. The functional activity of Evo-generated CRISPRCas molecular complexes and IS200 and IS605 transposable systems was experimentally
validated, representing the first examples of protein-RNA and protein-DNA co-design
using a language model. Similarly, scGPT is for learning single cell transcriptional data76,
ChemBERT encodes molecular structures as strings, which then can be used for different
downstream tasks such as drug discovery and material science77. Similarly, OmniJet-α is
the first cross-task foundation model in particle physics, enhancing performance with
reduced training needs78. Additionally, multiple physics pretraining (MPP) introduces a
task-agnostic approach to modelling multiple physical systems, improving predictions
across various physics applications without extensive fine-tuning79. The LLM-SR80
implements similar symbolic regression methods iteratively, generating and evaluating
hypotheses, using the evaluation signal to refine and search for more hypotheses.
Incorporating diverse scientific data modalities, which represent different
“languages” to interact with observations beyond natural language, is crucial. There are

10

two major approaches emerging: 1) End-to-end training on domain-specific modalities:
Models like ChemBERT77 (using chemical SMILES strings) and scGPT76 (using singlecell data), as mentioned above, are directly trained on these specialized data types. 2)
Separate training with compositional capabilities: This involves training separate encoders
for new modalities or enabling LLM agents to utilize tools that interact with these
modalities. For instance, models like BiomedCLIP81 connect biological images with
natural language, while PaperCLIP82 and AstroCLIP83 link astronomical images and
spectral data to textual descriptions. Furthermore, frameworks like ChemCrow84 leverage
the tool-using abilities of LLMs to connect with non-natural-language modalities, such as
chemical analysis tools.
Yet, as with text-based LLMs, several challenges remain. These include potential
biases in datasets, which can bias the performance and output of these models. Since
science is mainly about understanding systems, the scale, and opaqueness of these models
make interpretation a particularly challenging problem. Also, several observations, such as
their capability for generalisation, multi-modality, and apparent emergent capabilities,
have led to intense discussions at the research frontier on the extent to which these
foundation models can reason within and beyond their training regimes. The text-based
LLMs (or models incorporated with text modality) discussed above are constructed using
these techniques. Examples include GPT-4 (OpenAI)85, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representation from Transformers)86, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training,
OpenAI)87, and DALL-E from OpenAI88.
These foundation models have the potential to achieve professional human-level
performance or even surpass human capabilities when trained using reinforcement
learning, particularly with feedback from reliable formal systems. For example,
AlphaProof89

has become state-of-the-art in automated theorem-proving systems,

achieving mathematical capabilities comparable to human competitors at IMO 2024.
Approximately one million informal mathematical problems were translated into the
formal language LEAN, a mathematical proof verification language, enabling the LLM to
be trained through reinforcement learning. Solutions generated by the LLM in LEAN are
either proved or disproved by the LEAN compiler, with the resulting correct or incorrect
solutions serving as feedback to refine the LLM. While this approach has been explicitly

11

applied within the mathematical domain, it demonstrates significant potential for training
LLMs to surpass human performance in highly complex and deductive reasoning.
Although developing formal systems for general tasks remains challenging, reinforcement
learning methods are employed to build foundation models with enhanced deductive
capabilities, leading to the rise of reasoning models such as OpenAI o1/o370, Deepseek
R156, and others. In scientific domains such as physics, external and reliable feedback
mechanisms are already used to improve answer quality90 , highlighting the potential for
creating domain-specific foundation models.
In conclusion, the rise of foundation models will continue to affect and disrupt
science due to their powerful nature, scaling properties, and ability to handle very different
data modalities. However, for our purposes, the question remains of what extent foundation
models could be a proper gateway to making fundamental scientific discoveries. To what
extent can foundation models be creative and reason outside their training domains?

Toward Large Language Models as Creative Engines for Fundamental
Science
Here, we ask how AI can impact fundamental Science? That is, what is required for an AI
to be able to discover new principles of scientific laws from observations, available
conjectures, and data analysis? Broadly, can generative AI develop to become a “creative
engine” that can make fundamental scientific discoveries and pose new questions and
hypotheses? Einstein famously stated, “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55
minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions”. This
underscores the importance of carefully considering the question or problem itself, as
posing hypotheses effectively can be the most intellectually demanding part of Science. As
a first approximation, the ability to pose novel hypotheses is – at least for us humans –
what appears to be essential for making novel discoveries. Thus, what is required for an AI
to advance beyond a valuable tool for text generation and engineered systems for solving
a particular problem? Or could foundation models provide a possible path forward?
In our view, if LLMs are to contribute to fundamental Science, it is necessary to
assess what putative roles LLMs can play in the core of the scientific process. To this end,
12

we discuss below how LLMs can augment the scientific method. This includes how LLMs
could support observations, automate experimentation, and generate novel hypotheses. We
will also explore how human scientists can collaborate with LLMs.

Augmenting the Scientific Method
As a first approximation, scientific discovery can be described as a reward-searching
process, where scientists propose hypothetical ideas and verify or falsify them through
experiments91. Under this Popperian formulation, LLMs can assist scientific discovery in
two ways (Figure 2): On the one hand, LLMs could assist in the hypothesis-proposing
stage, helping scientists find novel, valuable, or potentially high-reward directions or even
propose hypotheses that human scientists might have difficulty generating. On the other
hand, LLMs have the potential to make experiments more efficient, accelerate the search
process, and reduce experimental costs.
At the stage of proposing hypotheses, scientists choose unknown areas to explore,
which requires a deep command of domain knowledge, incorporating observational data,
and manipulating existing knowledge in novel ways45,92. Their expertise and creativity
could carry the potential for proposing novel research hypotheses.
Then, at the verification stage, experiments are conducted to obtain relevant
information and test hypotheses. This requires the ability to plan and design experiments
effectively. Given LLMs’ planning capabilities and potential understanding of causality93–
95

, they can help scientists design experiments. By incorporating tool-using abilities96,

LLMs can directly implement experiments. LLM agents can perform complex workflows
and undertake repetitive explorations that are time-consuming for human scientists. This
allows us to search for novel results efficiently, which is key to scientific discovery97,98.

13

Figure 2: Illustration of the scientific discovery process: Scientific research can be
formulated as a search for rewards in an abstract knowledge space. By synthesizing
existing knowledge – represented by blue disks (human-discovered) and stars (humanmachine discovered)) – in novel ways, new knowledge (indicated by red stars) can be
explored. For specific research, scientists or LLMs need to traverse the hypothesesexperiment-observation loop, where hypotheses are proposed based on existing knowledge
(including LLM knowledge, and additional literature provided via RAG methods),
observation, and the creativity of LLMs. Then, with aid of external tools such as
programming languages, formal validations, and other methodologies, experiments are
conducted to test the hypotheses or gather data for further analysis. The experimental
results can be observed and described through the observation process, facilitated by
domain-specific models and the multi-modality capabilities of language models. All these
parts–observation, proposing hypotheses, conducting experiments, and automation–can be
assisted by LLMs and LLM-agents, considering the non-trivial implementations of
scientific environments in silico.
This process often involves a trial-and-error loop for a research topic or question. Thus,
scientific discovery requires the following steps: observation, hypothesis proposal,
experimentation, and automating the loop.

14

Expanding or Narrowing the Observation Process
Scientists rely upon observational results for guidance in proposing hypotheses, designing
and refining experiments, evaluating experimental results, and validating their hypotheses.
In general, observations act as dimension reduction methods99, which include annotating,
classification, and information extraction.
General purpose LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama, can be good observers for language
and image data for general purposes. Their in-context and zero-shot learning capabilities
can be used as universal classifiers to extract specific information from these data, such as
annotation and evaluation. In domains like NLP and Social Science, annotating and
evaluating language data at scale is a fundamental task for downstream experiments.
Trained humans or crowd-workers have often done such jobs. However, LLMs, such as
ChatGPT, can perform higher or comparable performance levels relative to crowd-workers
on annotation tasks, especially on more challenging tasks60,61.
Besides language processing, scientists must also describe complex behaviours at
scale qualitatively. LLMs show potential in describing such complex black-box systems,
where we observe only their inputs and outputs without knowledge of their underlying
mechanisms. Although deciphering such systems can often become a stand-alone research
question, having a qualitative description can still be helpful when faced with large-scale
data. With LLMs, black-box systems, such as language input-output, mathematical inputoutput pairs, fMRI data100, or observational data, can be described using natural
language100.
Beyond text and text-represented systems, different data modalities represent
different “languages” to interact with observations, and domain-specific modalities are
extremely important for scientific discovery. Scientific research often involves other data
types, including image, video, audio, table101,102, or even general files103, as well as domainspecific modalities like genomic sequences, chemical graphs, or spectra76,77,82,83. Multimodality LLMs can play the observer role vis-a-vis these data. However, most multimodality LLMs are still struggling to handle some domain-specific data formats, such as
genomic data or chemical compounds, which may require converting and where
information may be lost during the conversion process.

15

For highly specialised domains, domain-specific LLMs trained on specialised data can
achieve superior performance within their respective fields (representing the end-to-end
approach discussed earlier). For example, with the same number of parameters, BioGPT64
outperforms GPT-2 medium104 when trained on domain-specific data. Even with fewer
parameters, models like PubMedBERT62 can perform at a level comparable to GPT-2
medium. In the chemical domain, LLMs have been pre-trained on chemical SMILES
data105, enabling them to infer molecular properties and biological activities51. LLMinspired models are also useful for case-specific tasks. In106, transformers are trained on
cellular automata to study the relationship between complexity and intelligence. This
highlights the importance of exploring domain-specific and case-specific LLM and the
opportunities for further exploration in this area.
Experimentation and Automation
The experiment is a critical part of all research steps, including making observations and
validating the hypothesis. Both humans and LLMs need external tools to implement
experiments. Specifically, this involves calling external functions or directly generating
and running code. LLMs that have been fine-tuned for tool usage85,96 can generate
structured entities (often in JSON) that contain the function name and inputs to be
implemented by external functions. These functions are versatile and can include simple
calculations, laboratory control functions, external memory, requests for assistance from
human scientists, etc. LLMs can also direct programming by generating and running code
for complex experiments requiring fine-grained control or enhancing the calculation
abilities of LLMs107,108. Beyond this, generated programs can also call other functions or
be saved into a function library, enabling the combinatory development of complex
actions109.
For complex experiments, planning becomes important, which involves setting up
an objective and decomposing it into practical steps. This is critical to solving complex
tasks while sustaining coherent behaviour. While the planning capabilities of LLMs are
questioned in many studies, certain tools and methods still demonstrate valuable assistance.
The chain-of-thought (CoT)44 method significantly improves various tasks by
decomposing a question into steps. In complex tasks with more steps, where LLMs seek
long-term objectives and interact with environments, they can generate plans in natural

16

language based on given objectives110. It is also important to adapt to observations and
unexpected results. For this reason, methods like Reflexion111, ReAct112 combine the CoT
and planning, dynamically update its plans, manage exceptions, and utilizes external
information. And it also overcomes hallucination and error propagation in the chain-ofthought.
Automation is a significant aspect of LLM-assisted research, serving as a key
contributor to accelerating scientific discovery. Automation involves repetition and
feedback loops113. LLMs can be seen as a function -- prompt in, reply out – with human
users as the driving force behind making LLMs produce output. To automate such a
system, the key is to replace the human user. For instance, an LLM-powered chemical
reaction system can perform Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions by incorporating an LLMbased planner, which replaces the human user. The planner reasons through the given task
and determines the next steps, including searching the internet for information on both
reactions, writing Python code to calculate experimental parameters, and finally calling
external tools to conduct the experiments. At each step, the results, i.e., the search outcomes
and calculation results, are fed back to the LLM-based planner to automate the system66 .
Another approach is to replace the human user with multiple LLMs and allow them to
communicate with each other114. Since such automation is not fully hard-coded and the
core of this automation is also an LLM, they can exhibit some emergent behaviour66,114,
adapting unexpected situations, which is vital for exploring new knowledge. Specifically,
automated LLMs can help in three dimensions of scientific discovery: scaling, enhancing,
and validation.
Scaling: Automated LLM agents can scale previously challenging experiments for
large-scale studies. Examples include inferring underlying functions from input-output
pairs115. The LLMs perform multiple rounds of trial and error to find the correct function.
This approach can extend to neuron interpretation of GPT-2 using GPT-4, which has
billions of parameters116. This method involves two layers of loops: the trial-and-error
process and the application to all the billions of neurons117,118. Both layers are timeconsuming for human scientists, and LLMs make such studies feasible. Another example
is when LLMs are used to infer the functionality of human brain voxels from fMRI
activation data, their proposed functions are first validated by calculating the probability

17

of observing the activation data given a specific functional hypothesis. Subsequently, the
hypotheses with the high probability are selected to aid in generating new hypotheses and
improving overall performance100. Lab experiments can also be parallelized with the help
of LLMs, which further accelerate the experiment speed and increase the potential for
scaling the scope of experiments110,119 .
Enhancing: The aforementioned scientific methods, such as hypothesis generation,
experiments, and observations, can all be enhanced by automation. One direct application
is using LLMs as optimisers: by iteratively providing historical solutions and scores, LLMs
can propose new solutions and ultimately achieve superior performance120. In both the
hypothesis-validation loop and in experimental trials, failed cases constitute valuable
feedback. When evaluators and reflection are incorporated into the workflow, LLMs can
improve their decisions, showing significant performance improvements compared to
simply using LLMs111. Iteration can also enhance the hypothesis generation stage. By
comparing hypotheses with existing literature on related topics, LLMs can iteratively
improve novelty by using this literature as a source of negative examples121. Another
enhancement comes from accumulating knowledge, which is critical to research success.
Many exploration tasks require accumulating knowledge and developing new strategies
based on this knowledge122. For example, Voyager109 uses GPT-4 to examine the space of
the Minecraft game. This study consists of three main parts: an automatic curriculum to
propose exploration objectives, an iterative prompting mechanism to write code to control
the game, and a skill library to accumulate the knowledge and skills gained during the
exploration, which is then reused in future explorations. Equipped with all these
components, this LLM-assisted explorer can explore the game more efficiently. While
game environments in silico are a non-trivial departure from real worlds in situ, they are
not too dissimilar from the biochemical simulation engines123 that scientists rely on today.
However, the current “physics” engines in-game systems are still inconsistent with the
physical sciences, and new simulation software technologies are needed to allow for any
AI-based exploration of multi-physics environments113. From a macroscopic viewpoint,
scientific discovery can also be considered a quality-diversity search process124,125, and this
Voyager study has shown how LLMs can assist diversity search in a new way by proposing

18

objectives, iteratively solving problems, and contributing to and utilising literature (skill
library).
Validation: Automated LLM agents are critical for validating hypothesis. Beyond
scaling and enhancing performance, research often involves multiple rounds of the
hypothesis experiment loop to meet scientific discovery's rigor and safety requirements.
This loop is essential given the probabilistic nature of LLMs126 and the hallucination
problem of LLMs127,128. Experiments show that repeatedly verifying the results from
LLMs’ observations and proposed hypotheses increases the likelihood of obtaining reliable
results129,130. A promising direction is leveraging formal systems to validate results and
hypotheses by translating generated hypotheses and answers into formal languages, such
as LEAN or Prover9131,132 . For instance, in131 , LLMs first generate multiple answers.
These answers are then translated into the LEAN language and verified using the LEAN
compiler to choose the correct responses. With these filtered answers, LLMs can aggregate
toward a final answer. Another example involves using Python code to aid validation.
While general programming languages are often not considered formal systems, they can
still disprove certain hypotheses. In133 , LLMs were prompted to solve the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks134 , which involve identifying underlying laws and making
predictions based on new initial states. LLMs initially propose hypotheses, which are then
translated into Python code. This Python code is used to disprove incorrect hypotheses.
Although these non-formal systems cannot fully validate hypotheses, they partially
perform validation and improve predictive accuracy. While humans could also conduct
such translation and validation processes, the high speed of hypothesis generation by LLMs
makes automated approaches more suitable. A limitation, however, is the reliance on LLMs
to translate hypotheses into formal languages, which may introduce errors in the process.
This suggests the need for caution when interpreting results, even if they have been tested
using formal systems.
Expanding the Literature Review and the Hypothesis Horizon
In brief, advancing beyond current knowledge includes using LLMs to explore unknown
territories in knowledge space, encompassing human discoverable, human-machine
discoverable, non-human-machine discoverable, and the entirety of the knowledge space,

19

as illustrated in Figure 2. Namely, to perform hypothesis generation and develop predictive
models of more complex systems. Hence, can LLMs do open-ended Exploration of the
Hypothesis Space? Can LLMs also explore complex environments in an open-ended way?
These are open-ended challenges addressing the (unknown) limits of the capabilities of
LLMs and Generative AI.
Proposing hypotheses is a crucial step in scientific discovery, perhaps the most
important since it often involves significant creativity and innovation. Scientists propose
hypotheses to explore unknown topics or address research questions. This step often
involves novel ideas, recombining existing literature, and key insights. Experiment design
and subsequent verification are based on these hypotheses. Thus, hypothesis proposing is
a central step that connects observation and experiments.
Evidence indicates that LLMs can propose novel ideas, such as drug
combinations135, with designed prompting, thus underscoring the importance of prompting,
as discussed previously. An example is the use of LLMs for drug discovery: In135 LLMs
are prompted to propose novel combinations of drugs for treating MCF7 breast cancer cells
while incorporating additional constraints such as avoiding harm to healthy cells and
prioritizing FDA-approved and readily accessible drugs. The experiment results
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively propose hypothetical drug combinations. More
advanced techniques can also improve novelty, such as asking LLMs to role-play as
scientists136 or iteratively provide feedback on existing similar ideas66. This is further
exemplified by the Virtual Lab project137, where AI agents, powered by LLMs, were used
to design novel nanobody binders against SARS-CoV-2 variants. LLMs effectively
functioned as hypothesis generators, facilitating rapid and innovative scientific discovery
that translates to validated experimental results in real-world applications. Although some
human evaluations show that LLM-generated ideas have lower novelty138, the fast speed
at which LLMs propose ideas can still be valuable. With proper instruction and background
knowledge, LLMs can act as zero-shot hypothesis generators139. LLMs can also generate
hypotheses semantically or numerically based on observations about the underlying
mechanisms for language processing and mathematical tasks140,141. With neuron activation
heatmaps, GPT-4 can propose potential explanations for neuron behaviour116.

20

Besides directly proposing hypotheses, a significant part of creativity combines
existing knowledge, making literature research critical. With their vast stored compressed
knowledge142,143, LLMs can be viewed as databases queried using natural language123. This
not only accelerates the search but also breaks down barriers of domain terminology,
making it easier to access interdisciplinary knowledge. For accessing more up-to-date and
domain-specific information, LLMs can help scientists by using the RAG method and
accessing internet information, see Figure 2. Generally, text embedding is used for
semantically searching vector databases45,92. For example, STORM144 proposes an LLMpowered literature review agent that, for a given topic, actively searches literature on the
internet from different perspectives and automatically generates follow-up questions to
improve depth and thoroughness. Another important example is Deep Research145,146,
which integrates internet browsing and reasoning to deliver more in-depth and relevant
literature review results. LLMs can propose novel hypotheses by retrieving related
literature as inspiration, finding semantically similar content, connecting concepts, and
utilising citations based on research topics and motivation121. Alternatively, it may require
additional ingredients or experiments to extrapolate and search outside current knowledge
domains.
This case also highlights the importance of the hypothesis-experiment-observation
loop, where each step is critical: hypotheses rely on observations, experiments require
hypotheses and planning, and observations depend on experiments. Such a self-dependent
loop is typical in scientific discovery and can be initiated either by starting with a tangible
step in the hypothesis-experiment-observation process or by allowing human intervention.
Human Scientists in the Loop
While we showcase the capabilities of LLMs in assisting scientific discovery, human
scientists remain indispensable. During the literature review stage, with the help of LLM
agents, humans can contribute by providing deeper perspectives or guiding the focus
toward the needs of human scientists144. In the reasoning processes, by identifying
uncertain reasoning and thoughts, humans can correct LLMs. This significantly improves
the accuracy of the chain-of-thought method, making the LLMs more reliable147. Human
scientists can be involved in further improving safety and reliability. For example,

21

ORGANA110 , an LLM-powered chemical task robot, uses LLMs to interact with humans
via natural language and actively engages with users for disambiguation and
troubleshooting. Beyond this, humans can assist LLMs to enhance performance with a
reduced workload. For example, by involving humans in the hypothesis-proposing stage to
select generated hypotheses, LLMs can perform similarly to humans133. At the experiment
stage, many lab experiments still require human implementation and correction of invalid
experimental plans67, and LLMs can request human help on these experiments66.
While the methods described above focus on LLMs as drivers of scientific inquiry,
we must clarify that human-in-the-loop is more aptly cast as LLM-in-the-loop,
emphasising “assistance” or augmentation as the practical value-added dimension of
LLMs. The opportunities described in this paper show potential to shift this mode of
scientific practice to be more reliant on AI-driven approaches, but not without significant
advances in AIScience approaches with respect to physics-infused ML and causal
reasoning and in rigorous testing systems for LLMs interacting with the natural world.

Challenges and Opportunities
While LLMs have shown signs of delivering promising results and of having positive
impacts on scientific discovery, investigators have recognised their limitations, such as
hallucinations, limited reasoning capabilities, and lack of transparency. Compared to
everyday usage, when applied to scientific domains, these limitations require careful
consideration, as scientific processes and discoveries require high standards of truthfulness,
complex reasoning, and interpretability. The scientific community’s increasing recognition
and communication of these limitations of LLMs is essential to enabling solutions while
also limiting expectations. Such rigour is a cornerstone of science and engineering, and a
requirement if LLMs are to play a practical role.
Beyond all this, LLMs also affect scientific research at the scientific community
level. While many papers and reviews involve LLMs’ assistance, LLMs still face
challenges in producing qualified reviews.
Hallucinations as Putative Sources of Novel Hypotheses
Hallucinations produced by LLMs, also called confabulation or delusion, refer to
artificially intelligent systems generating responses that contain false or misleading
information presented as fact. This is analogous to hallucination in human psychology,
though, for LLMs, it manifests as unjustified responses or beliefs rather than perceptual
hallucinations151. Hallucinating LLMs can make unsupported claims, thus failing to meet
a prior set of standards. While some “incorrect” LLM responses may reflect nuances in the
training data not apparent to human reviewers152 , this argument has been challenged as not
robust to real-world use153.

23

In scientific discovery, hallucination becomes a critical hurdle when applying
LLMs to literature review, data processing, or reasoning. Various methods have been
developed to mitigate hallucinations154. Using the RAG method, LLMs can reference
accurate source contexts and up-to-date information, which can reduce hallucinations155.
Knowledge graphs can also provide reliable information to reduce hallucinations64.
A self-RAG method can also reduce hallucinations, where the LLMs generate and verify
the reference contexts, and outputs are also verified by the LLMs themselves151.
156

proposes an even simpler solution: create answers for the same query multiple times and

vote for the final answer. This method can significantly improve the accuracy of outputs.
Repetition from prompt variation and reiteration can also detect hallucinations–by finding
contradictions157. By repeatedly generating the same context, LLMs may sometimes
generate contradictory content, which can be fixed by the LLMs themselves iteratively.
Another method to mitigate hallucinations is through self-verification. This often
involves decomposing the generated content into multiple fact checkpoints. For example,
the Chain-of-Verification method uses separate LLM agents to verify them individually
and update the original answer158. Such a verification process can also adopt RAG methods
for greater reliability159.
An important origin of hallucinations is the auto-regressive generation process of
mainstream LLMs, where errors may accumulate during generation146. Hence, as discussed
above, a general way to mitigate hallucinations is to decompose the end-to-end generation
process using chain-of-thoughts, the RAG method, multiple agents, feedback, and iteration
loops.
While significant research efforts target the challenge of how to control or limit
hallucinations, we may ask to what extent hallucinations are a bug or a feature. For
example, could hallucination provide a gateway to creativity in that it could represent a
steady stream of novel conjectures? An LLM could then be used to filter such a string of
hallucinated hypotheses and rank them to recommend which ones to test. This remains
unexplored territory, as far as we can tell.
Another approach to treating hallucinations is to move beyond a binary perspective
of trust versus distrust. Instead, similar to statistical confidence, we may quantify the extent
to which research conducted by LLM agents can be trusted. Current studies primarily focus

24

on confidence measurements at the foundation model level160–162 and the output level163.
Some

trustworthiness164. Additionally, efforts have been made to enable LLMs to express their
confidence levels160,165. However, confidence measurements at the LLM agent level are
primarily limited to success rates rather than trustworthiness, particularly when dealing
with open-ended tasks. Moreover, existing measurements predominantly rely on post-hoc
quantifications, which restrict their applicability in scientific research166. Therefore,
predictive trustworthiness quantification frameworks for LLM agents that collectively
consider foundation models, tasks, tools usage, workflow, and external feedback are
needed.
The Value of Reasoning and Interpretation in LLM-led Science
While LLMs have been suggested to perform reasoning on some tasks, they exhibit severe
defects in logical reasoning and serious limitations with respect to common sense
reasoning. Notably, while LLMs can correctly answer “X is the capital of Y”, they struggle
to accurately determine that “Y’s capital is X.” This is known as the “reversal curse”167.
Another example is shuffling the order of conditions in a query, which may reduce the
performance of LLMs. When the conditions are provided logically, the LLMs can often
perform correct inferences but may fail when the conditions do not follow a specific
order168. LLMs can also fail at simple puzzles, such as determining the odd-numbered dates
on a list of famous people’s birthdays169, or in simple questions like “Alice has N brothers,
and she also has M sisters. How many sisters does Alice’s brother have?” Many LLMs,
while achieving high performance on other benchmarks, have shown a lower success rate
on this task170. When faced with unseen tasks, which are common for human scientists in
research, LLMs exhibit a significant drop in accuracy even on simple questions, such as
performing 9-base number addition or writing Python code with indexing starting at 1
instead of 0. This suggests that LLMs may rely more on pattern matching than on
reasoning, contrary to what many assume171–173. Consequently, caution is advised when
applying LLMs to novel reasoning tasks, and incorporating human oversight into the
process is recommended173,174 . Another crucial aspect of reasoning is planning capability.
As discussed earlier, planning is essential for implementing experiments. While techniques

25

such as ReAct and Reflection demonstrate some planning capabilities in LLMs, their
effectiveness remains questionable. Current state-of-the-art LLMs often fail at simple
planning tasks175, such as Blocksword, and are unable to verify the correctness of their
plans175. In contrast, humans generally excel at creating effective plans for such tasks.
However, studies also indicate that integrating LLMs with traditional methods or solvers
can enhance planning success rates, reduce research time175, and provide more flexible
ways to interact when developing plans176.
Some reasoning improvement methods, such as self-correction, can also fail. When
LLMs receive feedback without new information or correct labels, self-correction can often
lead to compromised performance177. Such self-correction prompts may even bias the
LLMs, causing them to turn correct answers into incorrect ones. To mitigate this problem,
directly including all requirements and criteria in the query prompt is suggested instead of
providing them as feedback. This result also indicates that to make corrections, effective
feedback needs to include external information, such as experimental results and
trustworthy sources177.
While some progress has been made, more advanced methods are needed to address
these reasoning-related challenges. One crucial aspect to consider is consistency – when
different LLM agents generate different responses to the same query, the result is
considered inconsistent. Notably, the self-consistent method178 uses LLMs to answer the
same question multiple times and chooses the most frequent answer. The answers also help
people estimate uncertainty178, given that LLMs often behave too confidently179. Similar
methods have also been proposed in156. Other methods use different LLM agents to suggest
different ideas and then conduct a multi-round debate to arrive at a final answer180. As
illustrated in Figure 2, these LLM-agent methods can benefit all steps in the hypothesisexperiment-observation loop.
A straightforward but challenging route to scientific discovery is to fine-tune or
directly train a model. In181, the authors propose an innovative solution to the Reversal
Curse through “reverse training,” which involves training models with both the original
and reversed versions of factual statements. Considering the requirements for rigor and
prudence in scientific research, attention must be given to the limitations of reasoning tasks.

26

This is particularly important given that LLMs often exhibit reduced performance in
reasoning correctness when encountering novel tasks—a frequent occurrence in scientific
research, where the focus is on exploring unknown knowledge.
The Challenge to Understand LLMs, and the Opportunity to Understand by using
LLMs
A comprehensive scientific interpretation stimulates discussion and further
discoveries among scientists. This is especially important for LLM-assisted scientific
discovery– given that current LLMs are mostly black boxes, it becomes difficult to trust
LLM outputs. To understand LLMs’ behaviour, LLMs’ language capabilities can be
leveraged. There are two types of methods. First, LLMs’ hidden states can be used in what
are known as probing methods. The Logit Lens method182 applies the unembedding layer
to hidden states or transformed hidden states, enabling semantic understanding of LLMs’
hidden states. Representation engineering methods183 can further detect and control
emotion, dishonesty, harmfulness, etc., at the token level, allowing people to read their
hidden activities. Besides these, dictionary learning methods can also be used to understand
LLMs’ hidden states and activations, leading to a fine-grained understanding of LLMs.
The second method is to ask LLMs to explain their reasoning. For instance, the
CoT method or reasoning models 56can explain the thought process before generating
results or ask LLMs to explain their reasoning after generating results. However, the selfexplanation of LLMs is also questionable. Their explanations are often inconsistent with
their behaviours, and we cannot use their explanations to predict their behaviours in
counterfactual scenarios184. This suggests that LLMs’ self-explanation may not accurate
and not generalizable. Beyond this, LLMs may also hallucinate in their self-explanations,
including content that is not factually grounded184, making their self-explanations even less
trustworthy.
Despite the many difficulties in understanding LLMs, they present a significant
opportunity for understanding other systems – they can be used to understand data,
interpret other systems, and then prompt humans. By directly showing input and output
pairs to LLMs, including language input-output pairs115, mathematical function inputoutput pairs, or experimental data, LLMs can be made to explain these black-box systems,

27

including, fMRI data, complex systems like GPT-2, or, potentially, papers written by
human scientists that are becoming increasingly difficult to reproduce because of various
forces at play (e.g., an increasing number of publications and dubious incentives). This
indicates the potential of applying LLMs to explain data and other systems, even though
understanding them may still be challenging116.
This capacity to interpret systems is not limited to human language. Foundation
models in specific scientific domains offer domain-grounded interpretability, distinct from
the pitfalls of LLM self-explanation. Pre-trained on vast, specialized data, these models
learn the “language” inherent in that data. For instance, scGPT in single-cell biology
demonstrates this: its learned representations align with established biological knowledge,
and it utilizes attention-map visualizations to enhance transparency, elucidating gene
interactions that are subsequently validated by domain-specific evidence76. Although the
faithfulness of attention weight interpretability has been questioned in various cases185,186,
it remains widely used in many AI-for-science applications187. Models, including LLMs
that use transformer architectures, often inherently benefit from such emergent
interpretability for both feature attribution and interaction highlighting.
These approaches support viewing complex domain representations, such as Gene
Regulatory Networks (GRNs), as a form of decipherable “domain language.”
Understanding these intrinsic languages through models whose interpretations are rooted
in verifiable domain semantics, rather than potentially unreliable self-explanations,
provides a robust method for advancing scientific discovery in specialized fields.
The Impact on Scientific Practice and the Community
An open question is how much human science and scientists will be willing to let AI,
through technology like LLMs, drive scientific discovery. Would scientists be satisfied
letting LLMs set the agenda and conduct experiments with little to no supervision, or do
we expect to supervise AI always, driven by the fear of multiple levels of misalignment?
This is a misalignment between human scientific interests and the actual practice of
science, possibly forcing AI and LLMs to produce data as humans do, with its advantages
or disadvantages, including constraining the search space and, therefore, the solution space.

28

Beyond the individual deployment of the scientific method, scientific discovery
also happens at the community level, where scientists publish their work, share ideas, and
collaborate. We can consider the scientists and even entire scientific community as an agent
that learns from experiments and research publications in a manner similar to
reinforcement learning processes188. However, learning from failed research (or negative
results) is just as important as learning from successful studies189,190, yet it is currently
undervalued191. This may be because failed research is far more common than successful
research. However, with the massive text-processing capabilities of LLMs, we now have
the opportunity to systematically share and learn from failures. Therefore, we advocate for
journals and conference to encourage the publication of failed studies and negative results.
This learning process also depend on human values emphasising communication,
mutual understanding, and peer review. Evidence shows a significant adoption of LLMassisted paper writing and peer review in recent years. Estimates indicate that 1% to 10%
of papers are written with LLM assistance192 .In computer science, up to 17.5% of research
papers are estimated to be assisted by LLMs, a figure that mainly reflects the output of
researchers with strict time constraints193. Beyond papers, estimates also show that around
7% ∼ 15% of reviews are written with LLM assistance194,195.
While LLMs can provide feedback that shows a high degree of overlap with human
reviewers, they are not proficient at assessing the quality and novelty of research196 . This
limitation is especially significant for high-quality research197 . Beyond this, LLM-assisted
reviews tend to assign higher scores to papers than human reviewers evaluating the same
papers194. Upon closer examination, LLMs also exhibit a homogenisation problem – they
tend to provide similar critiques for different papers196,198.
Despite LLMs displaying limitations at tasks such as peer reviewing and raising
ethical concerns in directly generating academic content, they may still benefit scientific
communication. For example, most researchers today are non-native English speakers, so
they can benefit from LLMs’ language capabilities that fit their diverse demands for
proofreading198, helping alleviate the current bias towards Western Science. On another
application, LLMs’ code explanation capabilities may help scientists understand poorly
documented code, making existing knowledge and work more accessible to a broader range

29

of scientists198. With significant growth in using LLMs for writing papers, such impacts
will become increasingly important193.

Table 2: Challenges and opportunities in applying LLM in scientific discovery. There is much room for
AI4Science as a field to fill in gaps under the listed themes, especially as LLM research matures over
the next several years; consistent with all innovations in scientific practices and engineering standards,
the demonstration-through-validation of said innovations requires time and resources several fold
greater than are available in “safer” domains (where LLMs are currently embedded).

misleading information [151]

Conclusions
In this perspective paper, we reviewed the rapid development and integration of large
language models (LLMs) in scientific research, highlighting the profound implications of
these models for the scientific process. LLMs have evolved from tools of convenience—
performing tasks like summarising literature, generating code, and analysing datasets—to

30

emerging as pivotal aids in hypothesis generation, experimental design, and even process
automation. As AI advances, foundation models have emerged, representing adaptable,
scalable models with the potential to apply across diverse scientific domains, reinforcing
the collaborative synergy between humans and machines.
LLMs have reshaped how researchers approach the vast amounts of scientific
information available today. By efficiently summarising literature and detecting
knowledge gaps, scientists can speed up literature review and idea generation.
Furthermore, LLMs facilitate interdisciplinary research, bridging the knowledge divide by
summarising complex ideas across fields, thereby fostering collaborations previously
limited by domain-specific language and methods. Beyond these benefits, the massive textprocessing capabilities of LLMs create new opportunities for utilizing failed research failed
research, which has received limited attention. Therefore, we encourage the scientific
community to promote the publication of negative results and failed research.
The utility of LLMs in designing experiments is another notable advancement.
Models like CRISPR-GPT in biology exemplify this by automating gene-editing
experiment designs, significantly accelerating genomics research. Moreover, LLMpowered autonomous systems like BioDiscoveryAgent indicate a shift towards AI-driven
experimental processes that can augment researchers’ efficiency and, more importantly,
enable scientific exploration previously constrained by resource limitations.
So, Large Language Models (LLMs) present two contrasting roles in scientific
discovery: accuracy in experimental phases and creativity in hypothesis generation. On the
one hand, scientific research requires LLMs to be reliable, accurate, and capable of logical
reasoning, particularly for experimental validation. On the other, there is value in
promoting creative “hallucinations” or speculative ideas at the hypothesis stage, which
mirrors human intuition and expands research boundaries208.
Besides the general foundation models like GPT-4, Claude and Deepseek, domain
specific foundation models have shown special potential for applying LLMs in scientific
research Notable examples such as Evo and ChemBERT showcase the success of domainspecific adaptations in genomics and chemistry, where they excel in predicting gene
interactions and molecular properties. These foundational models also highlight a
promising approach by treating genomic, chemical, and other scientific data as new

31

modalities for LLMs, similar to how images, videos, and audio are considered as
modalities. Integrating these modalities often follows two main strategies: end-to-end
training, where models like ChemBERT develop deep, intrinsic capabilities on specialized
data, potentially exceeding human performance on specific tasks; and compositional
approaches, which offer greater flexibility by leveraging intermediate modalities common
to human scientists (like vision and text) or specialized tools. While end-to-end methods
provide depth, compositional flexibility is crucial for adapting to diverse and rapidly
changing scientific demands. Consequently, combining and scaling these scientific
modalities, particularly when models can be seamlessly inserted into various scientific
workflows, has the potential to profoundly transform scientific research.
Despite the promise, current limitations pose significant hurdles to fully realising
LLMs as independent scientific agents. Among these are reasoning limitations,
interpretability issues, and challenges like “hallucinations”—where LLMs generate
plausible-sounding but inaccurate information. While helpful in generating hypotheses,
these models require careful oversight to prevent misleading or unverified information
from influencing scientific processes.
The challenges of reasoning and hallucinations pose serious concerns regarding the
use of LLMs in scientific discovery. Instead of treating LLMs as simply trustworthy or
untrustworthy in a binary manner, we suggest an analogy to statistical confidence, using a
continuous value—it may term as algorithmic confidence— to quantify the trustworthiness
of an LLM agent system in scientific research. We further suggest that all LLM-assisted
research should either be verified by humans or undergo algorithmic confidence testing.
The interpretability of LLMs also remains a complex issue. Their black-box nature
can obstruct transparency, limiting trust in outputs that affect high-stakes scientific
decision-making. Consequently, researchers continue to explore methods such as probing,
logit lens techniques, and visualisation of neuron activations to demystify the decisionmaking processes within these models. Increased interpretability will be critical as we
strive for ethically responsible and scientifically sound applications. On the other hand, it
is essential to recognize that LLMs are showcasing their potential to explain other blackbox systems through their language and reasoning capabilities.

32

Integrating LLMs into scientific workflows brings ethical considerations,
particularly regarding transparency and fairness. For instance, LLMs hold the potential for
democratising access to scientific information, aiding researchers from non-English
speaking backgrounds in publication and collaborative research. However, they also risk
perpetuating biases present in training data, thereby influencing scientific outputs and
potentially reinforcing existing disparities in research.
Another concern involves the over-reliance on AI in scientific processes. As we
incorporate LLMs deeper into workflows, human oversight becomes essential to
maintaining scientific rigor and addressing potential misalignments between AI-generated
outputs and human-defined research goals. The question of how much autonomy AI should
have in guiding scientific inquiries raises ongoing debate about accountability and the
evolving role of human oversight.
To harness LLMs as creativity engines, moving beyond task-oriented applications
to generate new scientific hypotheses and theories is paramount. For LLMs to contribute
meaningfully to fundamental scientific discoveries, they must be equipped to recognize
patterns and autonomously generate novel, insightful questions—a hallmark of scientific
creativity. This would require advancements in prompt engineering, automated
experimentation, iterative reasoning, and building an AI that evolves its approach based on
experimental feedback. However, a significant gap in general reasoning capabilities
separates

current

models

from

domain-specific

superhuman

systems

like

AlphaGo/AlphaZero209,210. AlphaGo leveraged a critical symmetry where an “answer” (a
move) inherently generates a new “question” (the next board state challenge)—a dynamic
largely absent in today’s reasoning models, yet key for mastering novel tasks. For scientific
discovery, developing this symmetry is crucial, as the ability to ask questions is as
important as answering them; though some preliminary work has explored this211, it
remains an unsolved and highly challenging problem.
The evolution of LLMs and foundation models signals a transformative era for
science. While current applications largely support scientists in managing data and
expediting workflows, the future may see these models as integral components of the
scientific process. By addressing challenges in accuracy, interpretability, and ethical

33

concerns, we can enhance their reliability and pave the way for responsible AI in scientific
contexts.
Looking ahead, the collaboration between AI and human scientists will likely
define the next generation of discovery. As we refine foundation models to become more
adaptable and creative, they may transition from merely assisting to potentially leading
explorations into uncharted scientific domains. The challenge lies in responsibly
developing these models to ensure they complement and elevate human expertise without
compromising scientific integrity. Ultimately, LLMs and foundation models may come to
represent a synthesis of human and artificial intelligence, each amplifying the strengths of
the other. With continued research and ethical vigilance, LLMs have the potential to
accelerate and deepen scientific discovery, heralding a new era where AI not only supports
but inspires new frontiers in science212. This includes embracing and learning from
scientific failures and leveraging them to drive comprehensive exploration. As LLMs
evolve, they may reshape scientific methodologies, impacting how science values
discovery and reproducibility and may ultimately redefine the purpose of scientific inquiry.
