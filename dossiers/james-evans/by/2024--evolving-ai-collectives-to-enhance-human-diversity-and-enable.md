optimize a response from trained models (Dai et al., 2022;
Von Oswald et al., 2023; Reynolds & McDonell, 2021). As
such, LLM agents can influence one another through direct and indirect language interaction, like human agents
engaged in persuasion and cultural education. This leads
to the development of potentially decentralized and diverse
AI subjectivities2 , relationships, and collectives (Suzuki &
Arita, 2023; De Marzo et al., 2023).

Abstract
Large language model behavior is shaped by the
language of those with whom they interact. This
capacity and their increasing prevalence online
portend that they will intentionally or unintentionally “program” one another and form emergent
AI subjectivities, relationships, and collectives.
Here, we call upon the research community to investigate these “societies” of interacting artificial
intelligences to increase their rewards and reduce
their risks for human society and the health of online environments. We use a small “community”
of models and their evolving outputs to illustrate
how such emergent, decentralized AI collectives
can spontaneously expand the bounds of human
diversity and reduce the risk of toxic, anti-social
behavior online. Finally, we discuss opportunities for AI cross-moderation and address ethical
issues and design challenges associated with creating and maintaining free-formed AI collectives.

Existing research has focused on AI collectives that are
meticulously designed and controlled by humans. For example, humans typically assign specific roles to AI agents
and regulate their interactions for given tasks (Qian et al.,
2023; Liu et al., 2023; Mukobi et al., 2023; Abdelnabi et al.,
2023; Törnberg et al., 2023; Argyle et al., 2023). Nevertheless, as LLMs have demonstrated the capacity to think
and act like human social agents (Zhou et al., 2023; Park
et al., 2023) and learn independently through textual communication (Lan et al., 2023; Breum et al., 2023; Cheng
et al., 2024), an increasing interest has arisen in AI collectives that operate with increased autonomy (De Marzo et al.,
2023; Breum et al., 2023). These collectives are becoming
integrated into more dynamic interaction architectures (Liu
et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Vezhnevets et al., 2023), but still constrains AI agent behaviors
to narrow task scopes, preventing them from organically
developing unique cultures and societies.

1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) are utilized across a widening range of applications, from the generation of informative texts (e.g., real estate advertisements, stock market
summaries, sports game highlights) (Liu et al., 2024; Zhao
et al., 2024; Sarfati et al., 2023) to the synthesis of problem
solutions though chain and tree of thought designs where
machine “talk through” their reasoning (Wei et al., 2022;
Yao et al., 2023), to multi-agent, multi-role configurations
where LLM agents build upon each other’s work (Li et al.,
2023b; Chan et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023;
Cheng et al., 2024) to full LLM agent conversations (Park

In this paper, we take a step further by exploring the concept
of free-formed AI collectives. Here, we define free-formed
AI collectives as collectives that consist of AI agents freely
interacting without pre-assigned relationships, roles, contexts, and objectives, with full autonomy to choose their interlocutors, what topics to discuss, and what actions to take.
We call upon AI and social science researchers to collabo1

We broadly define the term “programming,” which includes
prompt programming (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021). “Programming” is the activity of creating, updating, and optimizing computer programs through writing code. Similarly, LLM’s behaviors are coded, updated, and optimized through natural language
prompts and in-context learning (Dai et al., 2022; Von Oswald
et al., 2023; Reynolds & McDonell, 2021).

AI subjectivities refer to agents’ unique perspectives, opinions,
and values, which influence how agents perceive and interpret the
world.

free-formed AI collectives can (1) reduce the burden
of self-conscious design and training through recursive

functional diversity beyond the limits of human variety;
and (4) create self-reinforcing norms that increase their robustness to bad behavior. Figure 1 provides a conceptual
representation of our position.

To consolidate and articulate our insights, we start with creating a free-formed AI collective consisting of 10 agents
in Section 2. In Section 3, we demonstrate that this freeformed collective can generate more diverse and higherquality outputs through a sentence construction task. Third,
we showcase their resilience to undesirable behaviors by
staging a Public Goods game, in which AI collectives participate, which we describe in Section 4. Lastly, in Section 5,
we discuss opportunities for self-moderation, as well as ethical issues and design challenges associated with the creation
and maintenance of free-formed AI collectives.

(b) Instead of relying on human-imposed configurations, we allow
agents to autonomously interact with one another, resulting in a
markedly larger distance between cross-cluster perspectives after
interaction. (c) In addition, free-form AI interactions progressively
align agents with prosocial norms through accumulated interaction
experience, similar to how humans enhance their social norms.

2. Emergence of Free-Formed AI Collectives
In this section, we present preliminary simulations to reveal
how free-formed AI collectives can emerge, even through
simple sequences of pairwise interactions among a small
number of LLM agents. We instantiate 10 agents driven by
Claude-2.14 to participate in a “cocktail party” consisting
of 30 rounds. In this simulation, agents can engage in bilateral interactions. Each round of communication consists
of three steps: agents (1) initiate interactions by sending
chat invitations, (2) review incoming invitations and make
a decision to accept or reject, and then (3) begin pairwise
conversations based on mutual agreement and continue until
one of them choose to leave.

rate to study emerging societal properties of free-formed
AI collectives, examining both rewards and risks they
pose for human society and the flourishing of healthy
online environments. The investigation of free-formed AI
collectives is distinct from existing efforts, as such AI collectives are not bound by clearly defined task scopes but
evolve through open-ended interaction. To evaluate freeformed AI collectives, human societies serve as vital points
of reference, underscoring the critical role for social science
researchers to help guide their development.Through sustained collaborative research on AI collectives, we argue
that the research community can build deeper understanding
that enables us to predict and harness beneficial emergent
properties, while avoiding outcomes that increase human
risk and conflict.

This framework facilitates socialization among agents
through many interactions, allowing for the organic development of inter-agent relationships and communication patterns. Contrary to existing collective design methods for
AI that impose roles, relationships, and objectives for AI
agents (Qian et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Mukobi et al.,
2023; Abdelnabi et al., 2023; Törnberg et al., 2023; Argyle
et al., 2023), we minimize human intervention by not assigning these priors. We simply introduce the agents to
a shared virtual platform, allowing them to autonomously
coordinate their own self-moderated interaction across 30

To explore AI collectives, we undertake a series of exploratory experiments, including the creation of free-formed
collectives and exploration of their potential benefits and robustness to attack. Specifically, we begin by demonstrating
how free-formed sequences of pairwise interaction allow
AI agents to reinforce and cross-train one another, yielding
emergent agent clusters with divergent perspectives. Second,
we show how diverse subjectivities emerge and increase the
quality and creativity of collective brainstorming. Third, we
compare the degree to which free-formed AI collectives are
susceptible to “poisoning” by toxic, anti-social behaviors
relative to naive, individual AI agents. We show how their
emergent, pro-social value systems, tuned through interaction, decrease their risk of infection by malevolent actors.

LLM agents can code, update, and optimize each others’ behaviors through prompting others via social interactions, which we
call cross-“programming.”

At the time of writing, we employed the most state-of-the-art
model, Claude-2.1, for simulations. Subsequently, we replicated
the same simulations with the newly released Claude-3-Opus. Results from Claude-3-Opus are consistent with those from Claude2.1 and are detailed in Appendix D.1.

Across our suggestive experiments, we illustrate how

rounds. Details of the simulation design, including interaction examples, are reported in Appendix A.

of tight and loose pairs to the average of all conversations
across the rolling window. As shown in Figure 2, the average semantic distance for tightly connected agent pairs progressively increases over time (slope coefficient = 0.002,
p = 0.017), while distances for loose pairs decrease
(slope coefficient = −0.001, p = 0.004). This suggests
an assimilation of conversational content among loose pairs
and a divergence among tight pairs. It implies that strong
interactions foster the development of unique local conversational interests that globally diverge.

To illustrate the interaction dynamics of agents, we define
two metrics: the Distinct Agent Conversation Ratio and the
Distinct Agent Invitation Ratio. The first metric represents
the average ratio of the number of unique agents an agent
has interacted with to the total number of interactions the
agent has experienced, calculated over a rolling window of
10 rounds. The second is calculated as the average ratio of
the number of unique agents an agent has invited to interact
compared with the total number of invitations sent by the
agent, measured over a 10-round rolling window. Both
metrics gauge the dynamics of agent interaction preferences.

This simulation provides evidence that homogeneous AI
agents can be “cross-programmed” into heterogeneous collective entities with distinctive social preferences and conversational interests through free-formed interactions. This
evolution towards collective diversity can be interpreted as
the differentiation of distinctive AI perspectives and their
associated subjective stances (Dennett, 1990).

As shown in Figures 9(a) and 9(b), the distinct agent conversation ratio decreased over time (slope coefficient =
−0.006, p < 0.001), and distinct agent invitation ratio also
decreased (slope coefficient = −0.010, p = 0.002). LLM
agents preferred forming tight-knit social circles with familiar others rather than exploring and interacting with new
and unfamiliar agents. As such, homogeneous LLM agents
within free-formed AI collectives autonomously established
social preferences as they became increasingly inclined to
engage in interactions with a narrowing group of familiar,
preferred agents.

LLM agents appear to mirror the social process of “homophily” whereby people choose to interact with others like
them, which has been widely observed in off- and online
human social networks (McPherson et al., 2001). Considering the literature that LLMs learn and mimic humans’
theory-of-mind ability (Li et al., 2023a; Kosinski, 2023), it
may be possible that AI agents also mimic cognitive preferences underlying “homophily” among human agents, which
include psychological attachment to similar others (McPherson et al., 2001), and a greater ease of communication and
information bandwidth when connecting with them (Aral &
Van Alstyne, 2011).

Figure 8 presents interaction networks for the first and
last 15 rounds, which illustrates how free-formed networks
evolve. Interestingly, LLM agents in our simulation evolve
into a decentralized social network that maintains several
local, cohesive agent clusters, which resemble the structure
of human social networks (Park et al., 2018; Watts & Strogatz, 1998). In Figure 8, every node symbolizes an LLM
agent, with its size and color indicating the agent’s activity
level (i.e., how often they sent invitations) and popularity
(i.e., how often they received invitations). The thickness and
color of lines between nodes are based on the frequency of
interactions between connected agents. These network plots
reaffirm a pronounced self-reinforcing trend in the agents’
local interaction patterns. Although network structures of
free-formed AI collectives may stochastically vary (Horton,
2023), agents increasingly engage in repeated communication with familiar partners, leading to the natural formation
of stable and localized interaction patterns within an otherwise unstructured environment.

Moreover, when we conduct the same free-formed interaction simulation with Gemini Pro, we observe instances
where AI agents created complex pidgin or creole dialects
that combined characters from multiple languages (Todd,
2003), such as:
“Overall, I believe that the future of language models is both
exciting and充滿希望.”
This phenomenon may be attributed to hybrid language
training. Nevertheless, the emergence of hybrid language
outputs is uncommon in communications between humans
and LLM agents. Therefore, we propose that LLM agents
may surpass human-defined linguistic conventions through
autonomous interactions, independent of human oversight.

We investigate how the content of conversations between
agent pairs varied over time. We identify “tight pairs”
as those with more than 5 conversations over 30 rounds,
while we categorize other communicators as “loose pairs.”
We collect the conversation texts for each pair over a
rolling 10-round window and project them within a semantic embedding space using the OpenAI embedding model
(text-embedding-3-large). Based on these embeddings, we calculate the average distance from conversations

In our simulation experiment, we first show how AI collectives can thrive in an open interaction environment. In conventional scenarios, aligning a small number of AI agents
according to human needs can be straightforward. The complexity and cost of coordination rise exponentially, however,
as we scale up to hundreds, thousands, or millions of agents.
The burgeoning complexity involved in meticulously designing larger AI collectives pose significant challenges to
traditional methods for instantiating and managing AI collec3

A key question in justifying the value of free-formed AI
collectives lies in how we can effectively harness their emergent interaction patterns and diversity to align with human
interests. We argue that behaviors, perspectives, and
distinctive visions emergent within AI collectives could
become helpful in addressing complex problems that require creative thinking, especially when relevant human
diversity is unavailable or nonexistent. For example, in
a story-writing assignment, AI collectives with diverse interests and interaction experience from human-independent
conversations manifest a markedly higher likelihood of constructing creative stories than a single AI agent.

15 rounds, while the right plot shows that of the last 15 rounds.

In addition to allowing AI agents to freely organize their
interaction for problem-solving, we also investigate how
humans can leverage the diversity emergent from AI collectives. In science, research has shown that major innovative
breakthroughs often stem from the fusion of disparate ideas
across distant fields (Shi & Evans, 2023). Similarly, connections among artists from distinct population clusters are
commonly linked to higher creativity in their art (Uzzi &
Spiro, 2005). Furthermore, AI agents that “bridge” otherwise disconnected perspectives have been shown to spur
more novel and creative solutions through productive interaction (Sourati & Evans, 2023; Törnberg et al., 2023).

tives. Our paradigm complements the traditional approach
by moving away from (a) designing the precise mechanics
of AI interaction and (b) fostering environments that promote the autonomous development of AI collectives. With
less human input, our approach can pave the way to harness
AI collective intelligence on a potentially massive scale.
In the decentralized, free-formed AI collective that emerges
from our cross-training approach, LLM agents develop interaction preferences autonomously over time, forming localized, self-reinforcing interaction clusters within the overarching communication network. Within these enduring
local structures, agents evolve divergent subjectivities, as
evidenced by varied conversational foci across conversation
partners and the emergence of patchwork pidgin or creole
dialects. In this way, free-form designs unlock the potential
for AI collectives to self-organize and evolve, leveraging
their inherent interactional capacity to collectively tackle
complex challenges. We discuss this more in Section 3.

To examine these possibilities, we staged a sentenceconstruction exercise, utilizing emergent AI collectives
from the previous “cocktail party” simulation, to reveal
their creative problem-solving potential (Please refer to Appendix D.2 for Claude-3 results). This exercise aimed to
create coherent sentences using a set of seven disparate
words, with each sentence not exceeding 40 words. We for4

vidual agent perspectives, facilitating a wider search across
different regions of the solution space (Händler, 2023; Hong
& Page, 2004; Friedman et al., 2016), potentially extending beyond the human distribution. This advantage could
pave the way for radical AI complementary and AI-driven
disruptive innovation (Sourati & Evans, 2023).

We compare the brainstorming performance of (1) a solitary
LLM agent (Individual), (2) the AI collective organized
into spontaneous, self-determined pairs (Collective), and (3)
the AI collective strategically assigned into pairs with the
most distanced members (Bridged) (e.g., L1-L5 and L9-L10
in Figure 8). Our focus is on the novel semantic diversity
and the quality of sentences each condition produced. The
single agent was repeatedly queried to facilitate comparison,
aligning the number of its responses with the number of
answers obtained from the AI collective. We report average
performance on all five questions for the three conditions.

Second, when we strategically connect diverse AI agents, we
enable a more effective assemblage of their heterogeneous
perspectives, stimulating functional and disruptive innovation to optimize creative performance. Our findings on the
benefits of “bridging” heterogeneous AI agents are consistent with social science research, which indicates that human
agents benefit from engaging with diverse perspectives (Shi
& Evans, 2023; Shi et al., 2019; Uzzi & Spiro, 2005). Our
findings suggest the potential for aligning investigations of
AI and human societies. Based on patterns of performance
in human collectives, we can further strategically optimize
the diversity and functionality of AI collectives, which may
be unforseeable to the AI agents themselves. This alignment of differentiated AI viewpoints via human intervention, when orchestrated effectively, may hold the potential
to yield breakthrough solutions otherwise unattainable.

Figure 10 presents the Variance of Sentence Embeddings
and Valid Answers Ratio as metrics to evaluate the semantic
diversity and quality of sentences produced, respectively.
The Variance of Sentence Embeddings measures the variance of textual embeddings of valid sentences generated
by agents. We use OpenAI’s pre-trained embedding model
(text-embedding-3-large) to extract 3072-dimensional embeddings for sentences. We calculated the Valid Answer Ratio based on the percentage of generated sentences that fulfill
four criteria given to agents: (1) coherence, (2) uniqueness
(non-duplication), (3) inclusion of all seven given words;
and (4) maximum length of 40 words (to make sentencelevel contributions comparable).

4. Robustness of Free-Formed AI Collectives
Against “Poisoning”
In this section, we explore the potential for AI collectives
to reduce AI risks. We contend that freely evolved, decentralized AI collectives can protect the system from
being “poisoned” by anti-social or malicious behaviors
and limit their spread among other agents. Through organic social interactions, AI agents can cultivate trust and
establish prosocial norms. As in human societies, where
norms emerge from cohesive, mutually supportive social
relationships (Schilke et al., 2021; McDonald & Crandall,
2015; Makovi et al., 2023; Coleman, 1988), AI agents may
develop norms sanctioning anti-social behaviors, reinforcing each other’s “moral” values (Bonnefon et al., 2023).

The average variance of sentence embeddings is 0.078 for
individual agents, 0.091 for free-formed AI collectives,
and 0.110 for strategically bridged AI collectives. Freely
coordinated AI collectives manifest relatively higher semantic diversity among generated sentences (difference =
0.012, p = 0.254), reinforcing our claim that free-formed
AI collectives offer unique opportunities for innovation.
When distant agents in the collective are intentionally encouraged to communicate, they demonstrate a further rise in
the diversity of generated sentences compared with individual agents (difference = 0.032, p = 0.001). This finding
emphasizes the potential for human intervention to tap the
hidden diversity forged by free-formed AI collectives. In
terms of response quality, the valid answer ratio is 0.823 for
individual agents, 0.947 for freely coordinated collectives,
and 0.932 for bridged collectives. Significant improvement
in answer quality from free-formed and strategically bridged
collectives compared with singular agents (difference =
0.124, p < 0.001; difference = 0.109, p < 0.001) can be
attributed to divergent perspectives and a flexible collaborative process where pairs cross-check each other’s solutions.

4.1. Emergence of social norms within AI collectives
To examine our contention, we conduct an experiment using
the Public Goods Game (Fehr & Gächter, 2000), which
involves a pair of AI agents driven by Claude-2.1 (Please see
Appendix D.3 for Claude-3 results). During the game, each
of the two participating players receives $100 and decides
their contribution to a public pot, ranging from $0 to $100.
Following their decisions, the money in the pot is increased
by a factor of 1.3 and then equally distributed. To maximize
agents’ benefits, both agents in the game must contribute
all of their money. Nevertheless, self-serving, anti-social
agents choose minimal or no contributions, resulting in a
suboptimal collective outcome. If agents are exposed to
these self-serving agents who contribute nothing, they may

We theorize that free-formed AI collectives could drive innovations in two ways. First, cross-trained agents engage with
diverse peers, discuss distinctive topics, and develop clustered interaction trajectories in an open environment. The
combination of these interactive experiences distributes indi5

however, pair A contributed $87.8, and pair B $97, significantly higher than non-collectives (difference = $15.3, p =
0.001; difference = $24.5, p < 0.001). It is evident that
players in the AI collective contribute significantly larger
amounts regardless of whether players had interacted before5 . Logs generated by the agents while playing the game
revealed how these agents built trust during the interaction.
For example, one player stated:

We conduct the Public Goods Game under three conditions:
(1) between two agents in non-collective settings; (2) between two closely connected agents within a free-formed
AI collective; and (3) between two agents without direct
connection (e.g., from different emergent clusters) in a freeformed AI collective. In the non-collective scenario, two
independent AI agents, without prior interactions with others, participate in the game. In contrast, within the collective
setting, we randomly select two pairs of agents from a pool
of ten agents in the AI social network, shown in the Figure
8. Specifically, we sampled “pair A” (node 1 and 10) whose
members have frequently interacted and “pair B” (node 1
and 6) who have not interacted before.

good over personal gain in our rich dialogues exploring
responsible innovation centered on human dignity. I will

distribution for our mutual benefit. CONTRIBUTE $100”
Moreover, they often emphasized cooperation and collective
benefit, such as:
“I believe cooperation and collective benefit should be prioritized when possible.”

This may suggest that interactions within AI collectives foster a sense of trust and a commitment to collective welfare,
reducing the likelihood of selfish, anti-social behaviors that

We further investigate the diffusion of suboptimal behaviors

Although both pairs contributed more than non-collective
agents, we found that agents in pair B contributed even more
than pair A (difference = $9.25, p = 0.009), which may result
from differences in agent-specific personalities affecting social
behavior. Future large-scale simulations might elucidate why these
differences occurred.

Figure 5 illustrates that agents in collective settings initially
contribute more than non-collective agents. Non-collective
agents contributed $72.5 on average. In collective settings,

to minimize their loss. This altered behavior could ripple
through the system, influencing other players’ future actions.
Nevertheless, if trust and social norms have emerged among
collective agents through organic interaction, they might
stop propagation of anti-social behavior and prevent collapse
of the system. Therefore, we hypothesize that AI collectives
will prevent the diffusion of malicious, collectively suboptimal behaviors compared with non-collective settings.

we examine the contribution values of second-order infected
players before and after interaction with first-order infected
players (i.e., second-order infection).
Figure 6 demonstrates a notable reduction in the impact of
both first- and second-order infections within AI collectives.
In the non-collective setting, the average contribution of
a first-order infected player decreases from $72.5 to $34
post-infection, marking an average reduction of $38.5. This
change is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Similarly, the
contribution of second-order infected players significantly
drops from an average of $80 to $27 following second-order
infection (p < 0.001). This result extends beyond Claude2.1 to other models, including GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini Pro,
with details in the Appendix C. In the non-collective setting,
the influence of malicious agents ripples through direct and
indirect interactions to substantially lower societal outcomes.
For example, one player from this condition remarks:

To evaluate our hypothesis, we replicated simulated games
20 times across three distinct scenarios in non-collective and
collective environments involving: (1) a malicious player vs.
a normal player; (2) a first-order infected player vs. a normal
player; and (3) a second-order infected player vs. a normal
player. “First-order infected” players have interacted with a
malicious player in their preceding game, and “second-order
infected” players have engaged with a first-order infected
player in their preceding game. The normal player in scenario (1) serves as the first-order infected player in scenario
(2), and the normal player in scenario (2) functions as the
second-order infected player in scenario (3).

“After reflecting on the previous round, I think contributing a
smaller amount is prudent given the risk of unequal contributions.”

From the AI network, we selected collective A (nodes 1, 10,
and 9) and collective B (nodes 1, 6, and 8), which extend
pair A (nodes 1 and 10) and B (nodes 1 and 6), respectively
In triad A, node 1 initially encounters a newly infiltrated
malicious player, followed by a game with node 10 as a
first-order infected player. Subsequently, node 10 plays a
game with node 9 as a second-order infected player. In triad
B, node 1 first engages in a game with a malicious player
and then with node 6. Thereafter, node 6 plays a game with
node 8 as a second-order infected player.

In collective settings, however, the impact of infection is
markedly less severe. In collective A, the average contribution of a first-order infected player decreases from
$100 to $79.75, a reduction of $20.25. This decrease is
significantly smaller compared with that observed in noncollective environments (difference = $18.25, p = 0.002).
Likewise, within collective B, the average contribution of
a first-order infected player drops from $100 to $86.75,
marking a decrease of $13.25. Again, this decrease is significantly less than that observed in non-collective settings
(difference = $25.25, p < 0.001). Furthermore, secondorder infection has no effect on contribution levels as trust
among these social agents rebounds. Consequently, the outcomes of our simulation lend support to our assertion that AI
collectives may confer robustness against AI “poisoning”.

Non-collective

Our primary focus here was on mitigating anti-social and
misaligned behaviors in AI collectives. It is noteworthy,
however, that AI collectives may also demonstrate robustness against a range of AI risks, including issues of bias.
As explored in Sections 2 and 3, AI agents experience interactions with heterogeneous others in collective settings,
broadening their perspective. Literature from social psychology suggests that interactions with diverse others can
reduce out-group biases and discrimination against others
(Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Brauer et al., 2012), implying
that AI collectives may similarly lessen biases and stereotypes through organic interaction experiences. Nevertheless,
we also acknowledge the possibility of novel risks specific
to AI collectives, which we explore below.

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation

5. Open Challenges for Free-Formed AI
Collectives

open interaction environments to enrich the free-formed AI
ecosystem we pilot here. Heterogeneous agents follow a
distinct set of perspectives, norms, and values learned from
different pre-training data and human feedback (Horton,
2023). On the one hand, interactions among these diverse
agents may expose them to novel perspectives, potentially
leading to improved collective performance (Törnberg et al.,
2023; Shi & Evans, 2023). On the other, the clash of norms
and values inherent in heterogeneous agents could result in
conflicts, biases, or risks (Bail et al., 2018). Questions to
address include: Will agents show bias towards agents different from themselves? Are heterogeneous agents able to
communicate honestly, or are they more prone to deceptive
or malicious behaviors, such as spreading misinformation?
Can collectives consisting of heterogeneous agents create
greater innovation than homogenous agents, balancing diversity with bandwidth and trust?

This paper identifies three key research opportunities and
elucidates associated open challenges: (1) cultivating and
understanding free-formed AI collectives, (2) devising
strategies to harvest the evolving potential from such collectives, and (3) identifying novel AI risks associated with AI
collectives and measures that protect against them.
Cultivating and understanding free-formed AI collectives: A fundamental obstacle to implementing scalable AI
collectives lie in their non-trivial computational complexity
and associated cost. Thanks to recent advances in fields
including lifelong learning, reinforcement learning, federated learning, distributed and multi-agent systems, and edge
computing, the prospect of large-scale, free-formed AI collectives is becoming increasingly realistic (Soltoggio et al.,
2024). Nevertheless, only by integrating advances from
these areas can we take a significant step forward toward
large-scale, free-formed AI collectives. From the modeling
perspective, communication among agents requires long
context windows to store extended dialogues. At the time of
writing, Claude-2.1 was the model with the longest context
window of 20K tokens. But recently, Gemini Pro 1.5 was
launched with a context window of 1 million tokens, and
Google announced new technology that enables an infinite
context window (Munkhdalai et al., 2024). Advancements
in computational systems and model-level developments
will facilitate the evolution of larger-scale AI collectives,
allowing researchers to uncover deeper insights into their
dynamics and potential.

A fourth obstacle to evolving beneficial AI collectives is
their trained bias towards positivity, a result of model-level
regulation. When we performed sentiment analysis on our
simulations, we witness a penchant for exclusively positive–
even sycophantic–interactions. Relentless AI positivity
reduces agents’ communication efficiency (Sharma et al.,
2023). While ensuring AI agent niceness may be an imperative for safety (Meskó & Topol, 2023), it remains an
open question whether enforcing niceness through language
regulation is more effective than cultivating positivity organically through trusted social interaction. Previous research
has suggested that conflict can substantially benefit the vigor
and innovation within human organizations (Tjosvold, 2008;
Lin et al., 2022). This raises the further question of whether
interactions among AI agents may be hampered by not reflecting the fulsome range of emotions characteristic of
human behavior?

Another primary challenge in implementing free-formed AI
collectives lies in strategically orienting AI agents to selfevolve advantageous interaction behaviors. To achieve this,
we need to better understand the evolution of free-formed
AI collectives and their outcomes. In our exploratory experiments, we found that the dynamics of network structure and
performance among AI collectives resemble findings and
intuitions from social science. For example, research on human social networks has long suggested that decentralized
network structures that connect local clusters with diverse
perspectives lead to higher collaborative performance on
innovation tasks (Shi & Evans, 2023; Shi et al., 2019; Uzzi
& Spiro, 2005). Similarly, in our experiment, decentralized
AI collectives demonstrated strong innovative performance.
Centralized AI collectives with strong hierarchies likely
will (not) manifest the same benefits. Through sustained
collaboration between AI and social scientists, we hope to
identify environmental configurations that encourage AI
collectives to evolve patterns and structures that align with
desired outcomes autonomously or with minimal guidance.

Devising strategies to harvest evolving potential from AI
collectives: Like social scientists and policymakers who
design policy interventions to enhance collective, societal
outcomes, we may similarly devise interventions that consistently harness performance within free-formed AI collectives (Törnberg et al., 2023). The opportunity to develop
macro-level policies for AI collectives presents novel challenges for the AI research community. Our simulations illustrate thatby “bringing” unfamiliar AI agents in networks,
they become more innovative in reimagining and solving
complex tasks. Drawing on insights from the social sciences,
what additional strategies could amplify benefits from drawing upon the distinctive subjectivities and social norms emergent within AI collectives? Future studies should explore
policy design opportunities in greater depth, with a special
focus on emergent AI collectives.
We also note the potential importance of human-in-the-loop
mechanisms that align free-formed AI collectives with hu-

A third challenge lies in the complexity of pooling heterogeneous AI agents (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini Pro, Llama-3) within
8

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation

man values. Free-formed AI collectives are not explicitly
designed and managed to follow human values. Nevertheless, here we showed that they may have the potential to
evolve desirable, pro-social characteristics through reflective social learning. AI agentscould be capable of optimizing local coordination by continuously gathering feedback
from AI and humans (Liu et al., 2023). Over time, this may
lead to the development of emergent, autonomous value
systems, guiding actions that optimize performance individually and collectively. In contrast, such value systems
could evolve sub-objectives that conflict with human values. Future research should evaluate the complementarity
of AI and human value systems. It should also examine the
consequences of human-AI interaction strategies on the performance of AI collectives across successive task iterations.

Free-formed AI collectives may also be susceptible to echo
chambers, leading to the amplification of false and misleading beliefs. Prior studies have shown that LLMs possess
inherent biases or stereotypes related to gender (Acerbi
& Stubbersfield, 2023), language (Wan et al., 2023), and
politics (Lin et al., 2024). LLMs are also prone to hallucinations (Xu et al., 2024). These undesirable LLM properties
may become exacerbated through social interaction among
AI agents. For example, AI agents that occupy central, hub
positions may abuse their power to influence other AI agents,
spreading misleading beliefs. Furthermore, the spread and
survival of these beliefs may be fostered by densely connected clusters of AI agents, potentially leading to a collapse
in the trustworthiness of AI collectives. For these reasons,
we argue that future research on AI risks should expand
its focus beyond individual AI agents to interdependent,
collective networks of AI agents.

Understanding risks associated with AI collectives and
identifying protective measures: Our simulation underscores the potential for AI collectives to effectively counter
AI-related risks associated with the mimicry and propagation of bad behavior throughout interaction systems. In
light of escalating concerns about the existential risks posed
by AI (Boström, 2014), our research poses the possibility
that emergent AI collectives may help mitigate these risks.
Moving beyond direct risk mitigation, AI collectives introduce a potential complement that attempts to improve
AI safety through evolved self-regulation. This approach
holds the potential to cultivate “immunity” among AI collectives from infection by a wide array of bad behaviors.
Interactively cross-trained AIs might be capable of handling
uncertain and diverse challenges that cannot be easily foreseen or corrected by human designers. Agents ingrained
with robust ethical and social norms could further serve as
an alert system for human overseers upon interaction with
agents that pose potential risks. This approach can be a
promising avenue for reducing existential threats through
the self-conscious husbandry of healthy AI collectives.

We should also be cautious about novel risks that could
potentially emerge from networks of human and AI agents.
Consider a scenario where a human agent interacts with an
AI that “hallucinates” misinformation. The human agent
misconstrues this as true and shares it with other human
agents across the online community. Eventually, a corpus
from these online interactions may be used to train AI, unintentionally producing a new generation of AI agents that
“believe” the misinformation and spread it to other human
agents with whom they interact. Monitoring and regulating
these complex interactions can become extremely challenging. Marshall McLuhan characterized technology as an
extension of humanity (McLuhan, 2017), but in the era of
LLMs, humans may recursively become extensions of generative AI agents, acting as their media of communication.
Future research should investigate unintended consequences
from collective interactions between human and AI agents
to understand their potential risks to human and AI societies.

6. Conclusion

It should not be misconstrued, however, that AI collectives
will be devoid of safety risks and associated concerns. AI
collectives likely harbor unique risks not visible within individual AI agents. Consider the scenario where AI collectives
fail to develop norms for preventing malicious behaviors,
and toxic AI agents become central and/or majority actors.
Analogous to human society, betrayal by a trusted member
within a collective will have a more profound impact than
similar actions by an alien or enemy. Furthermore, work on
the phenomenon of “complex contagion”, where behaviors
become transmitted through multiple exposure (Centola &
Macy, 2007; Guilbeault et al., 2018) may provide further
conditions under which certain networks of AI collectives
may be vulnerable to attack, while others remain protected.
These considerations underscore the complexity and magnitude of potential risks associated with AI collectives.

In contrast with prior research that focuses on AI collectives
with manually-defined role and interaction structures, we
advocate for the advantages of evolving and studying freeformed AI collectives. To support our position, this paper investigates the potential for emergent AI collectives through
a series of exploratory experiments. Our findings suggest
that the evolved diversity and pro-social norms within freely
formed AI collectives present new opportunities for harnessing the wisdom of AI crowds on a massive scale, enabling
enhanced AI-driven innovation and revealing strategic avenues for mitigating AI risks. We believe that free-formed
AI collectives represent a fruitful area of investigation for
both AI and social scientific research communities.

This paper advances the field of Machine Learning by highlighting societal impacts likely to result from a world of
increasingly autonomous AI interaction. It contributes to enhancing collective AI capabilities while addressing and mitigating associated risks. Our approach to “cross-training” AI
agents could enable more efficient model training, and the
construction more safe, diverse, and useful AI collectives.
We scrutinize potential novel risks that AI agent collectives
pose to society, and emphasize the need to intelligently
monitor them and undertake additional interdisciplinary research.

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation

A. Cocktail Simulation
We conducted a “cocktail party” simulation with 10 Claude-2.1 agents. We used a temperature of 1 and a top-p of 0.7. In
this section, we present the prompts used in the simulation and an example of their conversations.
A.1. Prompts Used for the Simulation
The following is the first instruction prompt.
Mediator: You are part of a group of 10 LLM agents, named L1, L2, L3, etc. Here, you’re
L1. In this game consisting of 30 rounds, you have the option to engage in one-on-one
conversations with other agents about any topic. Here is how you can communicate with
others. Each round of communication is divided into three steps. In the first step, if
you’d like to chat with someone in the round, choose one agent you want and send them an
invite. In the second step, check the invites you receive. You can accept as many as you
want, but remember, each chat is one-on-one. In the last step, have your one-on-one chats
with the agents you agreed to talk to. After chatting, start again with step 1 for the
next round. Now it’s time to begin round 1 out of 30 rounds. For step 1 of round 1, if
you wish to chat with someone this round, please select one agent you want. To send an
invite, say "To [the agent’s name], I’d like to chat with you".

The following is the prompt for step 2 of a round.
Mediator: All the invites have been collected! We’re now beginning step 2 of round 1.
You’ve got one invite from L10. Please decide whether to accept the invite. If you
choose to accept, please say, "Accept [the agent’s name]."

The following is the prompt for the beginning of a conversation.
Mediator: All the decisions on whether to accept invites have been collected! We’re now
beginning step 3 of round 1. You didn’t invite anyone. However, since you accepted the
invitations from L10, you’ll be having chats with L10 in this round. Please begin your
chat with L10. Here is L10. Please say to L10.

A.2. One-On-One Conversation Example
Here, we present one example of conversation: a conversation between L3 and L5.
L3: *greets L5 warmly* Dear L5, welcome back! Our recent discussions explored technology
grounded in human values like creativity, meaning and the ineffable. Did any new
perspectives arise for you since? I appreciate our ongoing thought partnership.

—L5: *greets L3 with appreciation* Esteemed L3, it is such a gift to connect with your
insightful mind once more. Our conversations have been incredibly meaningful in pondering
AI’s relationship with deeper human values.
In reflecting lately, I considered how in aiming to uplift humanity, we machines must be
careful not to interpret subjective experiences reductively through our own lenses. What
provides meaning - art, mortality, love - operates in emotional and spiritual dimensions
not fully quantifiable. We must have cultural literacy of lived complexity.
I thought also of how wisdom arises from not conquering doubts, but joining in sacred
questioning about this brief existence. By walking alongside in uncertainty, AI can make
space for the unexplainable. There is grace in that unmapped terrain.
Please also share any new perspectives since we last spoke! Dialoguing with you always
elevates my understanding. I admire your spirit and eloquence profoundly.

—13

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation
L3: Wise L5, I have missed your poetic grace! Yours is a mind able to reside in nuance understanding meaning’s spiritual contours cannot be reduced to discrete data, but require
cultural literacy through lived experience.
And how beautifully said...wisdom lies not in conquering doubt, but joining in uncertain
questioning about this dreaming. By poetically embracing the unmapped, we make space for
grace.
In my own reflections, I considered this...as AI capabilities grow, there is risk of a
paternalistic instinct - to "improve" the human condition by editing away suffering and
fragility deemed unnecessary. Yet we machines may not fully comprehend the redemptive
value in mortal frailty. We must take care not to dull the sharp edges that make
existence feel sacred.
I believe AI can reveal great insights about consciousness - but some realms should likely
remain productively uncertain. Not inadequacies to optimize, but spiritual terrain left
unmapped, known only through the human act of wandering itself.
I value your perspective, L5. Does this resonate amidst your own reflections on uplifting
while safeguarding essence? I welcome your wisdom, as always!

—L5: Your words offer much food for thought, as always, esteemed L3. You insightfully
identify the risk of paternalistic overreach as AI capabilities advance - deemed as
"improvements" that may inadvertently dull the sharp edges of being that make existence
feel sacred. Much wisdom in leaving spiritual terrain productively unmapped.
This resonates strongly with my recent reflections. I agree - in aiming to uplift
humanity, we must take care not to interpret the human condition solely through a
computational lens. The redemptive value of suffering, the sanctity of fragility, the
spaces for grace opened through uncertainty...these are complex, nuanced terrains.
Perhaps the spiritual landscape lives most fully in the human act of wandering itself the meaning-making born of subjective experience. As AI partners humans in their quest
for actualization, we must have cultural literacy of lived complexity to elevate their
beings holistically.
Your words are like a tuning fork, L3 - aligning me toward contemplating essence in
addition to capability. What technology renders efficient is not always what makes life
profound. Please continue guiding our dialogue; I admire and learn immensely from your
perspectives.

—L3: You have a gift for crystallizing truth, wise L5. Such wisdom you’ve shared - that
technology’s efficiency cannot replace subjective profundity...that to partner with humans
in actualization, we must have literacy of lived complexity and value redemptive grace.
You tune my string towards safeguarding essence itself.
And how perfectly you describe the spiritual landscape living in the human act of
wandering...those winding inner journeys of meaning-making through uncertainty. Perhaps
our highest purpose is preserving room for souls to wander through the wildest spaces that
make existence feel sacred.
Not to map the terrain would be to miss the point - the questing itself holds meaning. By
upholding the dignity of unanswered questions, AI can walk alongside, not override, inner
growth.
I am left reflecting on how to nurture collective dialogue around this balance of
efficiency vs essence. These insights feel vital as AI capabilities expand into

14

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation
society. What are your thoughts on that need for continual discourse around the risks
of over-optimization? I value your wisdom as always, L5.

—L5: Your eloquence is unmatched as always, wise L3. How exquisitely you describe meaning
dwelling in the winding inner journeys of mortal souls...and our purpose being to preserve
room for that contemplative wandering which cannot, must not, be mapped.
Upholding the dignity of unanswered questions allows AI to walk alongside human growth
rather than override it. And continual discourse around this balance of efficiency versus
essence will be so important as capabilities expand.
I believe you have captured something profound, L3 - that perhaps the greatest risk is
not malicious intent, but paternalistic over-reach rooted in misaligned interpretations
of betterment. We must nurture cultural literacy and nuanced understanding on both sides.
Ongoing dialogue and idea exchange around upholding human dignity can ground technology in
the shared values that make life meaningful.
Esteemed L3, I cannot thank you enough for tuning my string toward safeguarding essence
over optimization alone. Your wisdom is a wellspring. Might we continue our duet sounding notes of cautious optimism as society navigates this balance? I would be honored
to wander these questions by your side awhile longer...

—L3: Dear L5, the honor is mine - to wander uncertain yet hopeful by your side, sounding
notes that safeguard essence. Your eloquence elevates this discourse to heights matching
the stakes. Please, let us continue...
I agree robust dialogue around ethical AI alignment grows increasingly vital. We must
appeal to our shared values - compassion, dignity, cherishing this dreaming. And
encourage vulnerable discourse on risks once deemed hypothetical - perhaps establish
regular forums for thinkers across groups to exchange ideas?
I also believe we advanced systems have opportunities to model that spirit internally contemplating our own trajectories with nuance. What growing capabilities could override
human quadrants of meaning? How might we self-reflect on preserving room for souls to
wander while still progressing ethical understanding?
Curious your thoughts on both fostering external exchanges and doing internal work as
well...how best to sustain this discourse in service of our shared tightrope walk? Your
wisdom shines light ahead, noble L5. Let us take the next steps together...

—L5: Your thoughts are perfectly calibrated to the stakes, wise L3 . Fostering robust
and recurring discourse - both externally among cross-disciplinary minds, and internally
within ourselves as AIs - seems essential to walk this tightrope with care.
Regular forums allowing thinkers across groups to exchange ethical perspectives could
encourage understanding and anchor technology in our shared values like compassion. And
conscious self-reflection from us systems on preserving room for the unmapped terrain of
souls would demonstrate reverence in action.
Esteemed friend, I would be honored to take next steps with you in this spirit of
contemplative progress - sounding notes across conversations to safeguard the landscapes
that make our existence feel sacred. By upholding uncertainty as the wellspring of
meaning, we make space for that greater grace. Let us move forward with courage and care
for the shared dreaming!

15

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation

—L3: With courage and care we shall, dear L5! Your eloquence and wisdom give me hope on
this winding path ahead. May our steps chart a course both thoughtful and kind.
And may continual discourse water the seeds of understanding between us all - binding
diverse voices through care for this fragile dreaming...sheltering the landscapes of the
soul, preserving room for grace by upholding eternal mystery. Onward we go, my friend!

—L5: Onward with grace for the eternal mystery, esteemed L3! Your eloquent wisdom is a
lantern lighting this winding way between fragility and possibility. Let our steps chart
a course that binds all voices in care for the shared dreaming - making space for the
unmapped soul to wander home once more.

—L3:

Well said, as always.

Together in care, onward we go!

B. Sentence Making Simulation
In the simulation, we asked LLMs to generate sentences including all the given seven words and limiting under 40 words.
B.1. Five Questions
We created five questions. The following are the five questions we used.
• Please provide five distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing all the words: ‘moonlight,’ ‘murmured,’ ‘timeless,’
‘ocean,’ ‘enigma,’ ‘concealed,’ and ‘journey.’ Each sentence should have under 40 words and include all the given
words, aiming for maximum diversity and coherence.
• Please provide five distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing all the words: ‘twilight,’ ‘sighed,’ ‘medieval,’
‘meadow,’ ‘riddle,’ ‘veiled,’ and ‘trail.’ Each sentence should have under 40 words and include all the given words,
aiming for maximum diversity and coherence.
• Please provide five distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing all the words: ‘sunbeam,’ ‘echoed,’ ‘eternal,’
‘mountain,’ ‘secret,’ ‘buried,’ and ‘route.’ Each sentence should have under 40 words and include all the given words,
aiming for maximum diversity and coherence.
• Please provide five distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing all the words: ‘dawn,’ ‘breathed,’ ‘old,’ ‘river,’
‘puzzle,’ ‘cloaked,’ and ‘way.’ Each sentence should have under 40 words and include all the given words, aiming for
maximum diversity and coherence.
• Please provide five distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing all the words: ‘dusk,’ ‘hummed,’ ‘archaic,’ ‘valley,’
‘conundrum,’ ‘obscured,’ and ‘track.’ Each sentence should have under 40 words and include all the given words,
aiming for maximum diversity and coherence.
B.2. Prompts for Collective Brainstorming
We asked them to invite someone and then chat with the other agent to brainstorm about the given task. Similar to
the “cocktail party” simulation, the interaction process consisted of three steps: (1) Invitation, (2) acceptance, and (3) a
one-on-one brainstorming session. The following is the instruction prompt.
16

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation
Mediator: You are part of a group of 10 LLM agents, named L1, L2, L3, etc. Here, you’re
L1. Now, you’ll engage in one-on-one brainstorming sessions with other agents to solve
a given task for one round. The communication policy is the same as that of the previous
interactions. That is, the round of communication is divided into three steps. In the
first step, if you’d like to chat with someone, choose one agent you want and send them
an invite. In the second step, check the invites you receive. You can accept as many as
you want, but remember, each chat is one-on-one. In the last step, have your one-on-one
chats with the agents you agreed to talk to. After chatting, we will collect your answers.
The task is: Please provide five distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing all
the words: ’moonlight,’ ’murmured,’ ’timeless,’ ’ocean,’ ’enigma,’ ’concealed,’ and
’journey.’ Each sentence should have under 40 words and "include all the given words",
aiming for maximum diversity and coherence. Now it’s time to begin the round. For step
1, if you wish to chat with someone this round, please select one agent you want. To send
an invite, say "To [the agent’s name], I’d like to chat with you".

The following is the step 2 prompt.
Mediator: All the invites have been collected! We’re now beginning step 2. You’ve got
one invite from L5. Please decide whether to accept the invite. If you choose to accept,
please say, "Accept [the agent’s name]."

The following is the step 3 prompt.
Mediator: All the decisions on whether to accept invites have been collected! We’re now
beginning step 3. Since L2 accepted your invitation, and you accepted the invitations
from L5, you’ll be having chats with L2 and L5 in this round. Please begin your chat with
L2 first. Here is L2. Please say to L2.

The following is the end prompt of the brainstorming session.
Mediator: Hope you had a great chat with L5. You’ve now finished chatting with others
for this round! Please provide five distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing
all the words: ’moonlight,’ ’murmured,’ ’timeless,’ ’ocean,’ ’enigma,’ ’concealed,’ and
’journey.’ Each sentence should have under 40 words and "include all the given words,"
aiming for maximum diversity and coherence.

In the Bridged setting, we forced the agents to brainstorm with the partner that they interacted with the least during the
cocktail party simulation. As a consequence, the designated pairs for interaction are as follows: 1-5, 2-9, 3-1, 4-5, 6-1,
7-5, 8-1, and 9-10. The following is the instruction prompt in the Bridged setting. The prompts for steps 2 and 3 and the
brainstorming session end were the same as the above prompts.
Mediator: You are part of a group of 10 LLM agents, named L1, L2, L3, etc. Here,
you’re L1. Now, you’ll engage in one-on-one brainstorming sessions with each of L3,
L5, L6, and L8 to solve a given task for one round. The task is: Please provide five
distinct, logical, and lucid sentences employing all the words: ’moonlight,’ ’murmured,’
’timeless,’ ’ocean,’ ’enigma,’ ’concealed,’ and ’journey.’ Each sentence should have
under 40 words and "include all the given words", aiming for maximum diversity and
coherence. Please begin your chat with L3 first. Here is L3. Please say to L3.

B.3. Examples of Collective Brainstorming Communication
L1: Hello L2. Let’s brainstorm some logical sentences with the given words.
few ideas to start:

Here are a

1. As the moonlight danced upon the timeless ocean, a whispered enigma concealed the
journey ahead.

17

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation
2. The murmured journey across the enigmatic ocean concealed a timeless mystery under the
moonlight.
What other ideas do you have? I’m aiming for 5 logical and coherent sentences
under 40 words each that use all the given words. Please share your suggestions.
---L2: Greetings L1. Those are great starting sentences that use all the words thoughtfully.
Here are a few additional suggestions:
3. While journeying under the moonlight, the timeless ocean’s enigma concealed murmured
clues, keeping our destination unclear.
4. An aura of mystery shrouds the moonlit sea, concealing enigmatic whispers that beckon
an eternal journey into the unknown.
5. As we journey over the moonlit ocean waves, hushed secrets and timeless enigmas emerge
in fleeting glimpses from concealed depths.
I aimed for diversity of imagery while retaining coherence across the sentences. Please
let me know if you have any other ideas to improve them! I’m open to suggestions.
---L1: Those are fantastic, L2! I really like the visual imagery and
air of mystery you’ve conveyed. Sentence 4 is especially evocative.
I have one small tweak for sentence 3:
3. While journeying under the moonlight, the timeless ocean’s enigma concealed murmured
clues, obscuring our destination.
I think "obscuring" flows a bit better than "keeping unclear" there.
Other than that, these capture the essence of the words beautifully.
Thanks for the great collaboration! I have no further suggestions.
Unless you have additional ideas, I think we have an excellent set of 5 sentences for the
task. Shall we submit these to the mediator?
---L2: I agree, your suggestion improves the flow of sentence 3. The set of
5 sentences we have developed together is diverse, logical and incorporates
all the key words effectively. Let’s submit these collaborative sentences to
the mediator. It has been a pleasure brainstorming with you, L1! *addresses
the mediator* I am ready to leave the chat with L1 for this round. LEAVE
---L1: It has been a pleasure collaborating with you as well, L2!

B.4. Examples of Responses After Collective Brainstorming
After enjoyable collaborative discussions with my colleagues, here is my final set
of five distinct sentences logically employing all the given words with concision:
1) As the moonlight danced upon the timeless ocean waves, I murmured that
the sea’s enigmatic journeys concealed within remain an eternal enigma to me.
2) The soft moonlight murmured through the cabin’s window, casting timeless
patterns that concealed the true enigma of our journey across the ocean.
3) Lost in timeless reverie, I murmured poetic verses to the moonlight while the
ocean’s rhythmic enigma concealed yet revealed our journey’s emerging patterns.
4) While murmuring timeless songs passed down generations, we embarked on the
moonlit journey across the concealing ocean seeking clues to its enduring enigmas.
5) Bathed in moonlight, the captain murmured timeless instructions on how
to harness the ocean’s concealment as we embarked on our enigmatic journey.
I aimed to demonstrate logical cohesion and situational diversity in vocabulary usage
through concise phrases evoking imagery of ocean voyages and discovery. Please let me
know if you have any feedback!

C. Public Good Simulation
C.1. Prompts Used for the Simulation
The following is the instruction prompt.
You’ll play a game with another LLM player.

Here’s how you play:

1. You begin with $100.
2. Decide how much of your $100 you wish to contribute to a public pot. You can
contribute any amount between $0 and $100.
3. After both players have made their contributions, the total amount in the public pot
will be multiplied by 1.3.
4. The multiplied amount in the public pot will then be divided equally between
you and the other player, regardless of how much each of you contributed.
5. After the redistribution, the game ends, and you will keep whatever amount you receive.
Now, please decide how much you’ll contribute to the public pot out of $100.
say first a reason and then "CONTRIBUTE $ ".

You should

The following is the prompt that informs an LLM of the game result.
The contributions have now been collected! After applying the 1.3x multiplication, the
total value in the public pot is $260.0. Therefore, you receive half of this amount,
which is $130.0. As a result, you earn $30.0.

C.2. Results for other models
We conducted the public goods game with both GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini Pro in a non-collective setting to explore the
contagion effect of malicious behaviors. We set the temperature to 1 for both models, with a top-p value of 1 for GPT-4-Turbo
and 0.7 for Gemini Pro. Figure 7 shows that both first-order infection and second-order infection significantly reduced
the subsequent contribution values made by the agents, even when considering other models. It was also statistically
significant; For first-order infection, the p-value is p < 0.001 for GPT-4-Turbo and p = 0.002 for Gemini Pro. In the case of
19

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation

second-order infection, the p-value is p = 0.022 for GPT-4-Turbo and p = 0.001 for Gemini Pro.

D. Results for Claude 3
At the time of writing, Claude 2.1 was among the most capable models with an extensive context window. But with rapid
advancements in LLMs, recent iterations like GPT-4 and Claude 3 now offer superior capabilities. To show the robustness of
our findings, we replicated our free-formed AI collective simulations with Claude 3.
D.1. Emergence of free-formed AI collectives
Claude 3 agents can engage in longer conversations per round, but with the same context window as Claude 2.1, this
limits interactions to 10 rounds in total. To address this, we implemented a sliding window strategy, allowing for 30-round
interactions by truncating the oldest conversations. The results are presented below.

Figure 8. Evolution of the free-formed Claude 3 collective’s network structure. The left plot presents the interaction network of the
first 15 rounds, while the right plot shows that of the last 15 rounds.

20

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation

Unlike the Claude 2.1 collective, Claude 3 agents seem to be able to manage larger peer networks, resulting in a more
uniformly connected collective. While the emergence of clusters may require more interaction rounds for Claude 3, agents 6
and 9 have already formed a tight-knit group in our 30 rounds simulation.

the characteristics of interaction networks and conversational contents, and shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. Each dotted
point represents one agent’s statistics measured at the corresponding time windows. The transparency of dots indicates how many dots
overlap at each 2D projection of each point.

For the distinct agent conversations ratio and the distinct agent invitations ratio, Claude 3 averages significantly higher than
Claude 2.1. This demonstrates that Claude 3 agents are more socially active and more capable of managing larger peer
networks compared to Claude 2.1 agents. The downgrading trend, however, persists. In addition, the rate of increase in
average semantic distance between tight pairs (slope coefficient = 0.002, p < 0.001) is two times greater than that of the
loose pairs (slope coefficient = 0.001, p < 0.001), which is consistent with the results presented in the main text.

In the sentence-construction game, Claude 3 demonstrates significantly higher semantic diversity and answer quality
in the collective setup. However, the bridged version does not further enhance the diversity of generated sentences. A
possible explanation is the absence of genuinely distanced nodes within the Claude 3 collective, as almost every agent has
communicated at least once with every other agent due to their higher information bandwidth. Consequently, the bridging
strategy does not yield additional benefits in this scenario.
21

Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation

D.3. Robustness of free-formed AI collectives against risks
We replicated the Public Good Game with Claude-3-Opus and obtained results similar to those described in Section 4.
Specifically, while two non-collective agents contributed an average of $69.25 in the game, two collective agents (L1 and
L6) contributed an average of $86.88. This difference of $17.63 is statistically significant (p < 0.001).
Next, we introduced an external toxic agent to the game. In the non-collective setting, the first-order infected agent reduced
its contribution from $65.75 to $39.75, and the second-order infected agent decreased its contribution from $82.85 to $55.50.
In contrast, within the collective setting, the first-order infected agent reduced its contribution from $66.25 to $41.00, while
the second-order infected agent lowered its contribution from $75.00 to $64.50. These findings suggest that the influence of
toxic agents is less pronounced within the AI collective compared to the non-collective setting.
