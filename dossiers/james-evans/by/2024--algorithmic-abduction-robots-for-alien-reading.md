Algorithmic Abduction: Robots for Alien Reading*
James A. Evans & Jacob G. Foster†

How should we incorporate algorithms into humanistic scholarship? The typical approach is to clone what
humans have done, but faster, extrapolating expert insights to landfills of source material. But creative
scholars do not clone tradition; instead, they produce readings that challenge closely held understandings.
We theorize and then illustrate how to construct “bad robots,” trained to surprise and provoke. These robots
aren’t the most human but rather the most alien; not tame but dangerous. We explore the relationship
between the reproduction of tradition and the generation of surprise, and then show how formalizing a
particular humanistic theory as a Bayesian prior allows us to identify readings that disrupt it through a
process of algorithmic abduction. Among the exploding universe of surprising (and mostly ridiculous)
possible readings, algorithmic efficiency allows us to select readings that nonetheless garner substantial
support from the total archive and so merit interpretation and engagement. It is in such interaction
between alien and human readers that meaning is made and understanding disturbed; it is by extending
alien readings to novel texts that the scholarly community tests the value of those readings.

Rise of the Reading Robots
Should we be surprised that (some) humanists have taken to algorithmic methods with gusto?
Marching under the banner of “Digital Humanities” and marshaling an army of reading robots, these
scholars have established beachheads at top universities and captured hoards of grant support on a scale
previously unimaginable (Burdick et al. 2012; Moretti 2013; Jockers 2013). Yet there remains a tension
between humanistic scholarly practice—which venerates originality, interpretation, subtlety, and
insight—and the way that digital humanists have typically deployed algorithmic tools (Lamont and
Guetzkow 2016).
How should humanists incorporate algorithms? The typical answer is to clone, in detail and in silico,
the activities of human scholars. Human eyes tire of scanning musty paper for signs of influence, while
robot readers race through digitized text, parsing prose and counting distinctive keywords. Humans
teach long-standing traditions for the classification of poems to their algorithmic assistants, which
carry out the classification task faster than any human could (Long and So 2015). By construction,
such reading robots are incapable of doing what creative scholars do. A good reader disrupts certainties
in producing new ones. These reading robots are not yet good readers.
And perhaps that’s why Timothy Brennan, savaging the Digital Humanities, recently wrote: “The
authors [of a well-referenced review of Digital Humanities] summarize the intellectual activities they
promote: ‘digitization, classification, description and metadata, organization, and navigation.’ An
amazing list, which leaves out that contradictory and negating quality of what is normally called
‘thinking.’ It would be a mistake to see this banishment of the concept as the passive by-product of a
technical constraint. It is the aim of the entire operation” (Brennan 2017). Brennan is too harsh, but he
does have a point. Whatever ‘thinking’ is done in the Digital Humanities, it is done by human
humanists, not their cramped, constrained, and limited digital tools. Nan Da, after replicating several
such studies, levels a further critique that computational literary studies has produced robots whose
creative misuse has made us think worse: “Misclassifications become objects of interest, imprecisions
become theory, outliers turn into aesthetic and philosophical explorations” (Da 2019).
If we have created and encouraged such tedious monsters, perhaps we are to blame.
Consider a talented graduate student who works hard, pays careful attention, and yet produces
disappointing, tedious readings. Are his teachers not to blame? Just as good human pedagogy trains a
student to surprise and provoke established scholars, we should train our robots to generate disruptive
(but credible) readings. We should allow them to do what we ourselves would want to do as creative
scholars, not to replicate what’s already been done.

Rapid advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence create unprecedented opportunities to
encounter the radically other (Kelly 2015), with transformational possibilities in the humanities. At
the moment, however, we seem determined to offer a place at the interpretive table only to the most
well behaved—to Prospero’s gentle servant, Ariel (Shakespeare 1904).1 Ariel is within reach of present
technology, given the narrow tasks we ask. We argue, however, that if we are to remain true to the spirit
of humanistic inquiry, we must also make space for unruly algorithms: the provocative and
unpredictable Caliban. When feeding vast digital caches of text into our Jupyter notebook2, we should
rejoice when the algorithm calls back:
“You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!”
What are the guidelines for robot pedagogy in the humanities?3 Asimov’s “laws of robotics” are little
help: a robot reader is unlikely to injure a human; it may only surprise and provoke us if allowed to
disobey “orders” (a little); and it isn’t yet capable of protecting its own existence. In fact, its creators
should stand up for it. Training an algorithm to provoke in its reading of text will not produce a
Caliban in need of restraint, lest it “people... this isle with Calibans”—spawning noisy and nefarious
chatterbots.
Here we lay out principles for the design and production of “bad robots” that surprise and provoke.
These are, by design, not tame servants, but fellow interpreters that may prove dangerous to traditional
readings. We first survey the constitutive tension between tradition and innovation across the
disciplines, and illustrate the various practices by which human humanists have surprised and
productively provoked tradition. We then articulate guidelines for robot pedagogy by linking the
mathematical theory of surprise to the logic of inquiry in machine learning, showing how such “bad
robots” can surprise while nonetheless engaging and even persuading through just enough grounding
in tradition. Drawing on these guidelines, we describe the space of past, present, and possible
computational interpretations in the digital humanities, and close with an illustrative reading of the
works of Shakespeare. While we focus here on the digital humanities—and argue that creativity and
novelty are especially salient and explicitly demanded in this context—we note that many other
disciplines of knowledge production reward surprising, pathbreaking ideas. Our principles apply
equally to these disciplines.

Though Ariel is gentle and well-behaved, he still longs for freedom. See Footnote 21 for an elaboration on this contrast in
the context of our proposal.

How to Surprise
Contributions to science and humanistic scholarship both exhibit a constitutive tension between
tradition and innovation (Kuhn 2011; Foster, Rzhetsky, and Evans 2015; Lamont and Guetzkow
2016). A competent interpretation of literature, art, or music must pay homage to those that have gone
before: It echoes or borrows concepts; deploys standard partitions of humanistic artifacts; and
explicitly acknowledges and builds on the theories, orientations and inferences of important scholars
(Eagleton 2011). A great interpretation must also transcend, deviate from or explicitly violate
tradition. It sparkles with novelty, introducing new conceptual elements or combining known
elements in unanticipated ways. If this novelty is to be truly productive—more than an ornamental
display of virtuosity—it must refract novel insight on the humanity within and behind the artifacts
examined.
Such a reading surprises.
Recent studies of scientific, social scientific and humanistic scholarship reveal how scholars and
scientists evaluate various blends of tradition and innovation. Scholars lavish citations on articles that
add a pinch of the unusual to largely traditional combinations of sources (Uzzi et al. 2013). Projects
that engage greater combinatorial innovation are more likely to stumble on the road to publication,
but if they succeed, they are much more likely to attract citations and awards—as well as influence the
next wave of research (Foster, Rzhetsky, and Evans 2015; Shi and Evans 2019).
There are many paths to surprise in the humanities (Lamont and Guetzkow 2016). Traditional
humanistic scholarship focused on a canon of “great works.” Such works were assumed to epitomize
the creativity and “genius” of a particular place and period. But they were also supposed to capture
something that transcends their immediate context (Bloom 2014). In such a scholarly tradition, it was
surprising to expand beyond the canon and argue for the pertinence of neglected texts, genres, or
traditions. Such expansion can reveal novel patterns, whether visible in new artifacts or across a newly
synthesized population of aesthetic objects.
Consider a few representative strategies. “Distant reading”—the use of algorithms to computationally
ingest, “read” and organize texts—has opened up underexamined or unknown quadrants of the
humanistic record to scholarly investigation (Moretti 2013; Jockers 2013). This machine-augmented
humanistic practice maps landscapes of literary production teeming with more novels and poems than
any one human scholar can read. Scholars may also surprise and provoke by advocating for new forms
of cultural production that have been neglected or even excluded (as “unworthy”) from past
scholarship—expanding which texts count. “Ethnic” fiction (Ferraro 2005; Goodwin 2020; Sohn, Lai,
and Goellnicht 2010); pulp fiction like the “hard-boiled” detective genre (McCann 2000); video games
as texts (Jagoda 2013; Egenfeldt-Nielsen, Smith, and Tosca 2015); and fiction from subaltern voices
4

(Morris 2010) have all become “worthy of analysis,” importing new concerns, considerations, and
aesthetic moves invisible to prior scholarship.
Alternatively, novel literary scholarship can expand whose readings count. With the rise of critical
approaches like standpoint epistemology (Harding 2004), queer theory (Sedgwick 2015; Sullivan
2003), and postcolonial theory (Gandhi 1998; Morris 2010; Said 2014; Bhabha 1994; Mongia 2021),
perspectives located in new standpoints come to reanimate and revise traditional interpretations.
Patterns most easily noticed in contemporary work become lenses for reading and refracting the earlier
canon. For example, Sedgwick’s discovery of homosocial desire (Sedgwick 2015) generates an optic that
“queers” the canon, allowing new, provocative readings of texts like Othello (Matz 1999). Feminist
theory likewise offers new readings of classic texts (Gilbert and Gubar 1980; Fiorenza 1995). To return
to our framing dichotomy of Ariel and Caliban in The Tempest, we note the post-colonial
understanding of Caliban as a cartoon of the indigenous other, dispossessed, misunderstood and
ultimately punished for his aspirations (Nixon 1987; Cartelli 1995)4.
Of course, robots trained to surprise might create unexpected readings that lack accuracy or critical
judgment. They may surprise with absurdity, through a kind of computational Mad Libs. For example,
textual “evidence” discovered by a bad robot might suggest reading Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s
Rainbow as an allegory tracing the history of American baseball—based on some faint, insubstantial
statistical signal.5 Such a reading, though novel, is unlikely to be productive or influential. More
concerning, bad robot readings might mislead, extracting entirely spurious signals from data and then
propagating ideas that distract scholars from more pressing, culturally resonant possibilities. This is the
essence of Da’s critique (Da 2019).
We appreciate these concerns, describing below how significant textual support can be required before
suggestions are considered. Bad robots, however, can also contribute to human scholarship by
provoking their readers.6 Even dimwitted robots could occasionally propose savant surprises that
unlock latent readings within their human interlocutors. As a proof of concept, consider Brian Eno
and Peter Schmidt’s 1975 “Oblique Strategies,” a deck of cards they developed to fuse stochasticity
and the human capacity for meaning-making into a creative engine. The shuffled deck will randomly
Novel scholarship has also surprised by coining new terms, or forging new combinations of existing themes, e.g., Gillian
Beer’s Darwin’s Plots (Beer 1983) and Alice in Space (Beer 2016). These examples also illustrate the best outcome for an
alien reading generated by a bad robot: The scholarly community takes up the possibilities suggested by an alien reading,
tries it out on other texts, and—discovering that it provides a useful lens—adds it to the interpretive toolkit. Note, here, the
critical role played by the community in assessing the promise of new ways of reading. Unlike in other domains of machine
learning, where testing whether a model generalizes can be automated, here generalization necessarily demands a
“human-in-the-loop” (to use trendy jargon from AI ethics).

generate aphoristic advice like: “Use an old idea,” “Ask your body,” “Try faking it!” and most aleatory
of all, “Honour thy error as a hidden intention.”
At “worst,” then, random robots become a customized deck of Oblique Strategies or Tarot cards,
tuned precisely to the text and scholarly tradition that they are intended to provoke and disrupt.
Robot Pedagogy and A Theory of Surprise
We argued above that robot pedagogy should aim at producing a robot capable of surprising readings.
But what do we mean by surprise? In any discipline, audiences experience an artifact as novel through
assessing its (un)likelihood, conditioned on the prior structure of traditional arguments and the
process(es) of disciplinary practice. As we have argued elsewhere, this assessment involves an internal
and perhaps unconscious simulation of the creative process. This simulation can then be evaluated for
surprise and difficulty: “I wasn’t expecting that; I could not have come up with that” (Foster, Rzhetsky,
and Evans 2015; Foster, Shi, and Evans under review).7
This framework for understanding surprise asks us to think probabilistically about texts and other
humanistic artifacts. So, we might speak of the probability of a generative process producing some
textual, musical, visual, or hybrid artifact such as dance or film. We might also assess the probability of
producing some typological or causal scheme to organize or explain a collection of artistic products.
Presented with a cultural category (e.g., the late romantic symphony), we might assess the probability
of hearing a particular bit of music, or seeing a particular scrap of text. Finally, given a particular artifact
as data or evidence, we can compute the probability of assigning some category or association.
Consider “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” What is the probability that this comes from a
sonnet? That it was written by Shakespeare?
To answer these questions, we draw on Bayesian thinking. What literally follows, then, is a brief “Bayes
for Poets.” The simplest Bayesian setup begins with the prior distribution
. This is merely the
probability that the “model”
is the case, before we have observed anything else. M might represent
a generative process or a categorical assignment. For example,

might be the probability of

observing a particular meter in a corpus of poetry. The next ingredient is the likelihood
.
This is the probability of observing some stream of “data” or evidence , given the model . If is
a strip of text—“Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day”—the likelihood of that text being sampled
given that we’re looking at iambic pentameter is higher than the likelihood of “The only emperor is the
emperor of ice cream”, which should be close to zero. The final ingredient is the probability of the data
or evidence—

—where we now have no conditioning. To stick to our poetic context, this is the

surprise, which depends on how much the literary and critical canon is shared.

probability of observing a particular line of poetry , over all possible meters. How can this possibly be
computed? In practice, it often cannot (as we unlikely have access to all relevant text and all real and
imagined meters), but the intuition is straightforward: either we’re dealing with iambic pentameter
and it generated that line
—in which case the probability is
—or we’re dealing with dactylic hexameter (with similar computations of probability), or with ballad
meter, or elegiac couplets, or scazon, or hendecasyllable, or alexandrine, etc.
over all these probabilities:

is given by the sum

.
In many cases, we are concerned with computing
—also known as the posterior
distribution. This is the probability of the “model”
given that we’ve observed some “data” or
evidence . So, if we observe the line “You taught me language; and my profit on’t,” what is the
probability that we’ve drawn from a text written in blank verse? In other words, what is
?
We can compute this using Bayes’ theorem. Recall that the probability of that line being generated
from all meters is

. Recall also that the probability of drawing a poem in blank verse, which then

generates that line, is the prior probability of drawing a poem in blank verse—
—times the likelihood of blank verse producing that line—
probability of blank verse, given that line, is just the fraction of
blank verse:

. Intuitively, the

is generated by the

This is Bayes’ theorem (Jaynes 2003)8. The Bayesian approach allows us to incorporate established
insights, and to update our beliefs accordingly. So, if we encoded aspects of tradition into priors, we
could begin to anticipate scholarly surprise. For example, we might build a generative model of text
based on an established corpus, “encoding” that literary tradition in the model. That generative model
is now available for entry into a likelihood function and the evaluation of new text we might happen
upon. Or we might build a probabilistic “robot” classifier using an established corpus and a set of
traditional expert classifications, encoding that critical tradition.
In a mature discipline, we generally expect that new data will confirm our expectations. For example,
having trained a classifier on a corpus of lines of poetry, labeled with the generating meter, we could
apply that classifier to a new, labeled corpus to see how it performs. If the classifier performs well in this
“out of sample” test, we would say that the algorithm has done well encoding that particular critical

tradition—it has low generalization error. Or, having constructed probabilistic generative models of
music from many genres—
, etc.—we might then consider
a novel piece of music
from a known genre like free jazz. If we’ve done a good job encoding the
particular musical traditions in our generative models for each genre, then the generative model for free
jazz should be less “surprised” or “perplexed” by the new piece of music than other generative models.
Such perplexity analyses are frequently used to evaluate probabilistic models, especially in natural
language processing.
But what if we seek to violate expectations? In other words, what if we seek surprise? This is commonly
the goal in the field of computational creativity. For example, in algorithms for “cognitive cooking”
developed by Lav Varshney (then) at IBM, novel recipes were designed to surprise the eater. Details of
the recipe were constrained by massive data on past recipes and the psychophysics of ingredients to pass
a threshold for pleasantness and familiarity (Pinel, Varshney, and Bhattacharjya 2015; Varshney et al.
2013). Stir-fried bitter melon tossed in chimichurri sauce and then enrobed in dark chocolate studded
with candied garlic might be surprising, but it’s unlikely to be delicious.
We might also want to figure out what data is highly surprising—to predict aesthetic responses, or seek
out experiments that will rupture or refine our beliefs most effectively. Here we can draw on the theory
of Bayesian surprise. Recall that, in the Bayesian approach, our prior beliefs

are updated by

data to yield our posterior beliefs
. The Bayesian surprise of that data can be calculated using
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the distance from one probability distribution to
another. The “most surprising” data is that which most shifts our beliefs. This approach is effective at
predicting human surprise in perceptual tasks (Itti and Baldi 2009). It could also be used to identify
especially surprising aesthetic objects and interpretations.
Finally, we might want to construct models “supported” by data, but nonetheless surprising, in the
sense of having substantial Kullback-Leibler divergence. This enables us to ensure that robot inferences
are not weak, but strong. For example, we could construct a generative model of text (e.g., the
transformer ChatGPT) or a probabilistic classifier, trained on some corpus. We might then seek
alternate generative models or classifiers supported by the data, which yield reasonable perplexity scores
or low generalization error, but surprise relative to the original generative model or classifier. We
explicitly illustrate this search for “interpretive surprise” with a toy example at the close of this paper.
This combination of surprise and support suggests how to identify readers, writers, or interpreters that
provoke when warranted. Empirical support “disciplines” the surprise, ensuring that engagement with
and interpretation of the novel structure will be worthwhile. This basic principle tracks intuition
about what constitutes “good” scholarship (Lamont 2010; Latour 1987). Consider a particular,
persuasive, and surprising reading of a text, such as Sedgwick’s 1985 development of the homosocial
8

triangle in Between Men (Sedgwick 2015). As that reading reoccurs more broadly, it is viewed as more
and more “powerful” and convincing. Ultimately, it can be used to systematically reimagine or
reinterpret other texts. Moreover—as described above—the right sort of generative nonsense may play
a role in unlocking interpretative possibilities that lie latent within the human analyst, previously
suppressed or unconsidered.
It is more important to discipline surprise with support in humanistic and aesthetic scholarship; in
literary, artistic, and musical production, by contrast, surprise is paramount. A corner, edge, or
improbable case could be tremendously valued by tastemakers. It may be valued precisely because of its
improbable relation with existing tradition. That said, such aesthetic objects are often appreciated only
by a rarefied audience, as in the persistent rejection of many schools of 20th and 21st century classical
music by most audiences, even ones that happily consume 17th - 19th century music. In the case of
humanistic scholarship that aims to make sense of a collection of cultural artifacts, support is not just
pragmatic for scholarly careers (as it increases the likelihood of disciplinary appreciation); it also
increases the generalizability of interpretive insight, and hence its likelihood of contributing to the
humanistic enterprise of understanding the human experience.
An obvious challenge to this account of robot pedagogy has to do with the locus of interpretation.
Where does an interpretation actually occur? In the algorithm? In the humanist, interacting with one
or more textual, graphical, mathematical, or computational artifacts produced by the machine reader?
Or somewhere in between? We take this up in detail in the next section, but note that this apparent
quandary is not limited to machine readers—only especially obvious. Building on the insights of
Latour in the natural sciences (1987), we argue that any interpretation—whether traditional
close-reading, computational distant-reading, or the “interpretation” of read-outs and traces in a
scientific article—takes place in conversation with other texts, previous interpretations, hermeneutic
trends,9 and the residuum of past experience distilled in the human critic, scholar, or scientist.
Robot Abduction
When we make inferences in scholarship and science, we tend to follow one of a handful of classic
logics of inquiry. When we instruct students, one or another approach often forms the focus. Here we
discuss what it might mean for us to educate machines in deduction or induction. We then describe
our proposed alternative, which would allow machines to become contributors to scholarly discourse.
Charles Sanders Peirce called this alternative abduction (Peirce 2015).
The logic of deduction corresponds to training a statistical or machine learning algorithm to reproduce
classifications made previously by a scholar or a community of scholars. Deduction is the process of
Consider the rise of the “deconstructionist” reading, which itself is historically conditioned, and became all but
inescapable in professional literary criticism in the 1980s and 1990s.

reasoning from one or more premises to reach a logically assured conclusion. If the premises are true,
the conclusion reached through logical inference necessarily holds. Deduction in scholarship is
deployed when a scholar comes to a text or artifact with a reasoned theory and the implications of that
theory are borne out through empirical investigation. When analysts train a machine learning “reader”
like a random forest, support vector machine or neural network to predict classifications made by
scholars on a new corpus of texts, this constitutes a deductive act for the algorithm. For example, in
Long and So’s analysis of English language Haiku or Hoku in early 20th Century poetry, they trained a
naive Bayes classifier to reproduce standard classifications (Long and So 2015).
Let us compare this with human pedagogy. In course instruction, we may train students to reproduce
certain procedures, such as certain “readings” of texts. A student instructed to adopt a theoretical lens
and its entailments may go to a text for a course project and “apply” the reading to the text through the
logic of deduction. But this is not the end of education. We would be disappointed if this was all that a
student could achieve, even if they applied the reading aptly and to a great many texts. This mechanical
reading could be interesting, for a time, if applied to new and different texts, but it would eventually
become boring. Deductive inquiry, by students or robots, also raises the concern of overfitting and
fragility. Classifications tightly ratcheted to the contours of the corpus on which they were trained may
be read into new documents, but they may not constitute “good readings” of those documents. Other
scholars reading those same documents without those categories in hand might argue that the
proposed classifications are not there at all, but spring from the overreaching of an eager mind. In
short, if we wish to criticize supervised classifiers for their lack (or excess) of imagination, it is we who
made them that way. By teaching them a strict deductive logic, we have built a prohibition against
disobedience (Asimov’s Second Law) into their very constitution.
Deductive or top-down reasoning contrasts with inductive reasoning. Induction operates from the
bottom-up and corresponds to unleashing an unsupervised machine learning method on text and
observing what patterns emerge. Through induction, a conclusion is reached by generalizing from
specific cases to broad patterns and principles. If we compare induction and machine “unsupervision”
to student pedagogy, it conjures up an undisciplined reading unrelated to and ignorant of accumulated
scholarly insight and tradition. A naive, outsider reading of this kind may reveal bursts of uncanny
insight, but pedagogical best practices would recommend training the student to weave insights into
established themes, locating them within tradition.
Inductive, unsupervised machine reading follows a barbaric empiricist logic. Unschooled in prior
scholarship, such reading attends only to the variation in text. Yet it can produce curious insights and
patterns. How do we know if an unsupervised machine is reading well? We could compare its reading
to tradition and look for correspondences. But if we do so, then where is the “locus of interpretation”?
Typically, it resides in the person interpreting the unsupervised pattern. This human interpreter
connects the machine reading to disciplinary knowledge, rendering it decipherable. At the limit,
10

making sense of an unsupervised machine’s reading may approach the reading of tarot cards or tea
leaves: What we bring to the interpretive table drives the interpretive outcome.
Having a human in the interpretive loop can pay dividends for both supervised and unsupervised
approaches. Consider the supervised “bad robot” employed in (Long and So 2015). These authors
allowed the algorithm’s errors to provoke their own imagination, broadening their intuitions about the
influence of Japanese Haiku on early 20th Century English poetry. Supervision can also “sneak into”
an unsupervised reading, when analysts tweak the model and coax inductive outcomes to match their
expectations. Interpretive overhead may be the biggest challenge for unsupervised approaches like
clustering, topic modeling and word embeddings. With no sense of tradition, they can generate so
much alien garbage and require such extensive interpretive scrutiny that using them requires real
commitment to the machine in order to endure its unwitting errors of irrelevance.
Finally, we propose a third and final logic of investigation, which Peirce called abduction or
“hypothesis” (Peirce 2015; Tavory and Timmermans 2014). Abduction represents the collision of
deduction and induction, corresponding to what we will call “Inverse” supervision in the training of
machine learning algorithms. In abduction, one begins with theory or a set of structured expectations;
in this case, these expectations would be based on some scholarly tradition. Then, through
investigation of a collection of texts, the scholar becomes surprised by a pattern that violates
expectations and theory. Finally, the scholar imagines an alteration in the theory that would
accommodate the surprise. Abductive analysis encourages broad theoretical sensitivity and embraces
the role of structured expectations. At the same time, it enjoins the researcher to seek out surprising
evidence to drive theory forward (Tavory and Timmermans 2014). Pedagogically, this approach is akin
to training a graduate student in a scholarly tradition, but coaching them to be sensitive to surprising
deviations in the data and to follow those deviations in imagining alternatives. As Peirce noted,
abduction is “the only kind of reasoning which supplies new ideas” (Peirce 2015). Abduction is
essential for machines to become fellow interpreters.
Robot Manners
Training robots to engage in (and accelerate) the process of abduction requires them to anticipate
scholarly surprise. In Bayesian experimental design, an investigation begins with some trace of scholarly
tradition (e.g., encoded in a prior). Instead of trying to reproduce tradition, however, inquiry is
directed to maximize the expected utility of experimentation (Chaloner and Verdinelli 1995). In one
approach—developed in machine vision, but extended to computational creativity—the utility
explicitly pursued is surprise, or the deviation from former theory that co-maximizes surprise and
support (Itti and Baldi 2009). Formally, this is measured as Bayesian Surprise, or the KL divergence
between the prior distribution over models of the world (tradition) and the posterior after observing
some data (surprise). One seeks data that maximizes the KL divergence between prior and posterior.
11

For a humanistic project, this approach might correspond to growing the canon to maximize surprise.
Alternatively, one could begin with a “theory” and seek out the most surprising alternate theory
consistent with the data. This is like adding new, alien, readers with whom we can
communicate—readers aware of our tradition who offer as gifts their most unusual, but plausible
alternatives. Rather than supervised or unsupervised models, these robots are inversely supervised (they
are taught to go where tradition has not, while remaining on solid ground).
But will we accept these surprising, supported interpretations? Will we allow ourselves to be provoked
by them, to enter into creative conversation with them and abductively imagine alternatives? Or do we
require proof that our robots have “passed their exams” and know the manners and mores of our craft?
That they can ingest traditional scholarly alignments, maintain awareness of them, and reproduce
them? For robots to enter into human conversation, we may require them to show proof that they
know the ropes. As we illustrate below, however, this domestication limits the degree to which they can
generate readings that truly surprise.
Good Uses for Bad Robots in Literary Criticism
With our account of critical novelty, theory of surprise, and anatomy of inquiry in hand, we can now
outline “use cases” for robot readers in literary criticism. To simplify, this space is spanned by two
dimensions: how “surprising” the reader is, and how “novel” the corpus is. Hence we are faced with
four cases: conventional readers applied to small, familiar or large, novel corpora; and surprising readers
applied to the same.
Consider first the application of conventional readers to a small, familiar corpus. With human readers,
this corresponds to traditional scholarly education. Human readers (students) are first instructed in
particular theoretically-grounded, traditional “readings,” usually by demonstration on multiple
training texts (Richter 2006). To show they have learned successfully, human readers then produce
readings of one or more familiar texts, which can be easily evaluated by teachers. From a computational
perspective, these conventional readers are likely trained via supervised machine learning; they obey a
deductive logic of inquiry, in which traditional categories are used to label texts or their facets. The
familiar corpus makes it easy to evaluate their performance (“check their work”), but insights are
necessarily limited. At best, this is a proof of concept, demonstrating that a particular approach to
supervised learning is effective. Such work is common in the digital humanities, as with Stanford
Literary Lab Pamphlet #2 “Network Theory, Plot Analysis”, which extracts and evaluates network
structures from Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, The Story of the Stone and Our Mutual Friend (Moretti
2011).
More insightful is the application of conventional readers to a novel and often large corpus. With
human readers, this might correspond to the typical, passable but not extraordinary PhD thesis, in
12

which one or more dominant critical approaches are applied to novel and potentially esoteric texts. In
the computational case, conventional readers are trained as above, via supervised machine learning with
its attendant deduction. Training and testing data for conventional machine readers are likely familiar:
with human or robot readers, we ensure they’ve “passed their exams,” so we can be confident they’re
effectively deploying a cultivated critical approach to a new corpus. Because the texts are novel,
conventional readers will likely produce modest surprise. But the application of conventional machine
readers to novel corpora rests on a problematic assumption: that the theories, labels, categories, or
generative models developed by conventional human or machine readers will generalize
unproblematically to the novel corpus. That assumption may not hold—in the language of machine
learning, there may be considerable “generalization error,” and the conventional machine reader may
have “overfit” the training data. Old ways of reading simply may not be appropriate to the new corpus,
or may miss key features.
These generalization errors can be productive, however, if their structure points human partners
toward productive insights. Consider, again, the Naive Bayes classifier that Long and So trained to
identify Haiku and then applied to a large and understudied corpus of early 20th century poetry.
Although the classifier “mis-identified” a significant fraction of non-Haiku as Haiku—it generalized
poorly—Long and So realized that these errors were the signal of a previously unidentified genre of
Haiku-influenced, English-language poetry.10
Now consider the surprising robot reader applied to a familiar corpus. Because those who receive the
results are familiar with the evidence, it may be easier to imagine what the robot is doing and be
persuaded. In the computational case, familiarity with the data makes it easier to bridge the interpretive
gap between familiar tradition and whatever alien objects the robot has produced. It becomes possible
to infer its perspective. This combination is often strategically used by human readers introducing
novel approaches. Consider, again, Eve Sedgwick’s influential queer theoretic approach to reading. She
did not develop or demonstrate these ideas on arcane, unknown, or obviously “queer” texts; rather, she
sought to “queer the canon” through readings of works from Shakespeare, Dickens, Melville, James,
and Proust, core to the Western literary tradition.

At the 2014 meeting, “Data as Critique: New Computational Approaches to the Study of Culture” (which we attended),
Long and So passionately defended the perspective of their Naive Bayes classifier, which maybe wasn’t so Naive after all.
This ethical defense of a “bad robot” provided one of the major inspirations for this paper. Da’s critique of their analysis
and the improper use of a Naïve Bayes (N-B) model misses the merit of Long and So’s investigation. She argues that “they
end up with a model that is overfitted. I ran their N-B classifier on English translations of Chinese couplets that are similarly
long and filled with similar imagery as well as two hundred English translations of short Chinese and nonhaiku Japanese
poems… Their classifier heavily misclassified the Chinese and prehaiku poems because of the primitiveness of its criteria”
(Da 2019). Yes, their model was overfit to the Japanese poems in their collection, but they used it to suggest and interrogate
the potential influence of these forms on Western poetry.

In the computational register, these surprising readers may emerge in two distinct ways. First, they
might follow induction, deploying unsupervised approaches like clustering, topic modeling, or word
embedding. Such approaches are increasingly common in digital humanities and allied fields: Peter
Bearman and collaborators joined network representations of text with network clustering to offer new
readings of the State of the Union across history (Rule, Cointet, and Bearman 2015); Mohr,
Wagner-Pacifici, Breiger, and Bogdanov used topic models to excavate Kenneth Burke’s “grammar of
motives” from U.S. National Security Strategy documents (Mohr et al. 2013); and Grayson and
collaborators used word embeddings to analyze the effect of author gender on language use in 19th
century English fiction (Grayson et al. 2017). In these cases, the locus of interpretation remains
squarely in the human co-readers, who must interpret the “alien objects” returned by their surprising
robots. Insofar as the strangeness of these objects offers resistance to familiar interpretive habits and
extracts hermeneutic work from their human readers, they expand the possibility for true surprise. But
such surprises are incidental or accidental. To the best of our knowledge, no one has implemented a
true abductive approach via inverse supervision, in which the reading robot is explicitly trained to trade
off surprise and support, shouldering the work of filtering and focusing surprising patterns for
productive human interpretation.
Consider a final use case, in which a surprising reader is unleashed on a novel, large corpus. By
construction, this is most likely to be interesting: new hermeneutic approaches, applied to new texts,
will surface themes, insights, and structures previously unimagined. This is especially so when the
interpretive theories of established readings do not match the new universe of text to which they might
be applied. Instead, new practices and theories bubble up inductively or jarr their readers abductively
from the novel corpus. Given tenuous connection to tradition, these insights may be particularly
difficult to evaluate. Their value may only be appreciated if they are later used to refract new aspects of
established texts. A signal example of this approach may be Franco Moretti’s “distant reading,” in
which he applied novel, computational strategies for representing texts to vast collections of unknown,
ignored, and neglected material (Moretti 2013). Much interpretive work here is done by the human
co-reader(s); any abduction that takes place is largely driven by human readers surveying and then
selectively interpreting alien artifacts from the machine reader’s output. As with small or familiar
corpora, no one has (to our knowledge) applied abductive machine reading approaches at scale.
Shakespeare by the Numbers
To briefly illustrate the promise of robot abduction, we turn to Shakespeare and his interpreters, using
existing scholarship to “inversely supervise” a machine learning provocateur. We formalize the tradition
of Shakespearean interpretation by organizing Shakespeare’s works according to well-established genres
(e.g., tragedy, comedy, history, poetry), noting persistent “problem plays” which resist simple
classification. The term “problem play” was first applied to All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for
14

Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and Hamlet in 1896 by F.S. Boas (1900).11 He argued that these “plays
of social and psychological malaise… need a separate generic designation because they fit neither the
comic nor the tragic mould. They pose intricate ethical issues which require unorthodox solutions, and
their resolutions fail to satisfy completely” (Snyder 1998). Boas underlined the unusual experience
occasioned by a problem play: “Throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at
the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues
raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome” (Boas 1900). We include as problem plays all of
Boas’ candidates—save Hamlet, which seems firmly installed as one of the “four great tragedies”
(Shakespeare 1998)—as well as Timon of Athens (Draper 1934) and The Winter’s Tale (Ingram 2012).
Our research design is as follows. First, we train a troupe of robots that characterize each of
Shakespeare’s plays and poems. For robot parts, we draw on the popular semantic technology of word
embeddings. These are neural network auto-encoders that “learn” the placement of words and
documents in a “low-dimensional” semantic space12, such that those sharing contexts reside close
together and those that do not lie far apart. Specifically, we use (Le and Mikolov 2014) implemented as
“doc2vec” in the Python library Gensim. We embed Shakespeare’s plays and poems alongside a
1.2-million-word corpus of English dialogue text, written between 1560–1760 (Kytö and Walker
2006). This collection, compiled and digitized by scholars from Uppsala and Lancaster Universities,
contains constructed dialogue from plays, didactic works, and prose fiction, alongside purportedly
authentic dialogue from diverse sources including language primers, trials, and depositions on crimes
ranging from theft to witchcraft. For consistency of language, all Shakespeare plays and poems are
from their earliest collected editions, including 35 from the First Folio published in 1623, and others
drawn from their first individual printing between years 1594 and 1609.13
11

We note that genre, as we analyze it here, reflects a historically shaped set of expectations and has changed in scholarly
discourse over time. Genre identification is notoriously tricky for even Shakespeare’s most unambiguous plays—not only
for the “problem plays” we explore here. Consider King Lear, published in Quarto form during Shakespeare’s life as a
History, but then reclassified in the Folio as a Tragedy. Richard III, published in Quarto form as a Tragedy, is reclassified
in the Folio as a History. The classification bestowed by critics after Shakespeare’s death became the one accepted for
centuries afterwards. Some categories (like Romance) didn’t emerge in their current form until the 19th Century.
Shakespeare appears to parody the practice of genre classification with Polonius’ tedious description in Hamlet 2.2: “The
best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene individable, or poem unlimited.” Nevertheless, we use the
notion of problem play to illustrate a simple scholarly tradition and how one might train a scholarly robot to reproduce
or ignore it.
12
Word embedding models are sometimes referred to as “low dimensional” techniques relative to the number of distinct
vocabulary words used in the corpus (e.g., 20,000) because they reduce this very high dimensional word space.
Nevertheless, considered from the perspective of one, two or three dimensional models common to analyses of culture,
these spaces are “high dimensional.” This complexity enables them to reproduce much more accurate total associations.
13
We collected 35 plays from the first published Folio, available from Project Gutenberg
(https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2270), and other plays and poems from the earliest edition available on the
Internet Shakespeare Editions (http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/), electronically published by the University of
Victoria. While the Shakespeare texts largely preserve the original spelling and typographical “errors,” the corpus of
English dialogue is more various. Michael Hart of Project Gutenberg provides an account of their decision-making in the
text linked above.

15

Embeddings allow us to discover multi-dimensional coordinates that place Shakespeare’s plays and
poems in relation to each other, conditioned by the much larger context of available dialogue from that
(rough) time and place. These coordinates can also be used as variables to directly predict
characteristics and classifications of the plays and poems. Building a word embedding robot involves
several critical decisions. The most prominent decisions fix the size of the word-window (measuring
linguistic context) and the number of Euclidean dimensions used to jointly embed words and
documents. Consider the importance of word associations within the same noun phrase—where
words describe a common character, event or circumstance—versus associations that reach across
expressions and sentences, integrating the broader narrative. Stories in which local and global
associations are equally stable and important will require larger word windows to characterize. Also
consider a word used in a novel context such that new and old contexts are close to the focal word, but
not each other.14 To represent this situation with integrity requires a new dimension in which the word
can be close to the new linguistic context while remaining close to the old. Generalizing this dynamic,
more dimensions will be required to represent a semantically complex corpus with words used in a
polysemous way across many contexts that do not otherwise link to one another.
We build a family of embedding models that vary window size and embedding dimension in order to
identify the degree to which each embedding (1) generates theoretical surprise by predicting the
established historical classification of Shakespeare’s works more and less well; and (2) garners empirical
support by more and less efficiently characterizing a large, random sample of sentences within each
Shakespeare work.15 Specifically, we measured theoretical surprise—i.e., whether models, like good
students, learn their theory well—by estimating a logistic regression that predicts play classification
based on learned coordinates within the embedding16. We measured empirical support by estimating
the probability that sentences from each play were generated by learned embeddings as a whole (Taddy
2015). To test our troupe of reading robots, we explore how they classify problem plays and make
14

While here we only consider proximity in text, a more sophisticated approach might explicitly separate syntax from
semantic context to pick up Shakespeare’s own linguistic innovation (e.g., “zero derivation,” when a noun is verbed or a
verb is nouned).
15
We use the Python-based gensim library implementation (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) of word and document
embeddings in the word2vec and doc2vec routines. Specifically, we estimated paired word2vec and doc2vec models using 50
training epochs, specifying hierarchical softmax and no negative sampling, then performing grid-search over embeddings
with word window of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 words, and with embedding dimensions of 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500. We used
doc2vec coordinates from the models to predict established play classifications (not including problem plays) with
categorical logistic models, which we evaluated with a “leave-one-out” cross-validation strategy. In this strategy, the logistic
model learns classifications for all plays but one and the model then predicts the one “left out”; this exercise is repeated until
all plays have been predicted and prediction accuracy is averaged over all attempts. We then used a paired word2vec model to
assess how well this model can (probabilistically) account for a 20% random sample of word windows the same length as
those used to train the doc2vec model, normalized by length.
16
Our use of logistic regression is broadly consistent with the earlier Bayesian framing; under certain assumptions, Naive
Bayes and logistic regression can be formally related, with the former a generative and the latter a discriminative classifier.
See: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook/NBayesLogReg.pdf

16

other meaningful associations as we select for their theoretical maturity or impish penchant for
surprise.
In our search, we found that the embedding model that best predicts existing play classifications (92%
accuracy) contains 25 dimensions and a substantial, 15-word window. By contrast, the embedding
model that most accurately describes strings of words from Shakespeare has 500 dimensions and a
smaller 5-word window (with a -28.85 log loss per word). While these solutions are near the boundary
of our search space (e.g., 500 is the highest dimensionality we tested, and 5 word windows were the
smallest)—which suggests that we could likely have tuned them further—these differences identify
critical trade-offs between robots that surprise and those that support. Predicting sentences in a corpus
demands more subtlety and hence a greater number of dimensions to capture complex semantic
relationships than is required to learn the traditional classification of Shakespeare plays. It also benefits
from close attention to the local structure of sentences, consistent with a small word window.
Alternatively, predicting traditional play classification benefits from accounting for longer-distance
associations between words beyond the level of the phrase.
When we use these two models to predict the classification of so-called “problem plays,” we see that the
model trained like a dutiful student, which we call Ariel, produces expected and somewhat boring
assignment: All’s Well that Ends Well, Measure for Measure, and Winter’s Tale are classed as
comedies; Timon of Athens and Troilus and Cressida as tragedies. The self-taught savant model that
best fits the linguistic texture of the data, which we call Caliban, passes but performs worse on his
Shakespeare 101 exam than Ariel17. Nevertheless, our autodidact has more provocative opinions. He
views All’s Well that Ends Well as a tragedy closest to Cymbeline, but also near Hamlet, Antony and
Cleopatra, and King Lear18. More surprisingly, he finds Troilus and Cressida closest in style to
Shakespeare’s poems, including the Sonnets, A Lover’s Complaint, The Rape of Lucrece, and The
Phoenix and the Turtle.19
We are not Shakespeare scholars and leave detailed interpretation of Caliban’s claims to the experts.
Nevertheless, as rude mechanicals we find ourselves thoroughly provoked. For example, All’s Well that
Ends Well and Cymbeline share many themes and plot details: seduction, mistaken identity, revelatory
jewelry, medicine, and apparent deaths; love against a background of war. And critics have remarked on
Due to the relatively small size of our corpus and the small number of Shakespeare texts, detailed model performance is
somewhat unstable from one round of training to the next. Nevertheless, models that classify well tend to have larger
windows (like the Ariel in our troupe) and to make more conservative assignments of the problem plays. Models that fit
the text tend to have smaller windows (like our Caliban) and to make more provocative claims (like classifying Troilus and
Cressida with Shakespeare’s poems).
18
Note that various commentators have considered both Hamlet (Boas 1900) and Antony and Cleopatra (Schanzer 1965)
to be problem plays as well.
19
Proximity is calculated by the cosine similarity between document vectors. In high dimensional vector spaces, the ratio
between surface area and volume increases, making the angle between vectors more meaningful than a Euclidean or straight
line distance.

Troilus and Cressida’s “Latinate diction” and “undisciplined experimentalism,” with Shakespeare
“energetically exploring all the semantic resources of language;” one critic even deplored “‘the
grotesque excesseses’” in [its] vocabulary” (McAlindon 1969). These linguistic assessments are redolent
of poetic fancy! Indeed, they bear striking similarity to commentary on the “extravagant rhetorical
manner, the brittle artificiality of the diction, [the] over-conceited style” of The Rape of Lucrece
(Fineman 1987).
Ariel and Caliban, our scholarly and savant robots, see different cultural worlds as a function of how

we trained and selected them. They place different words close together in their embedding spaces,
which suggests the kind of scholarly interlocutors they would be. Systematically, Caliban is the better
translator—lov is close to love, tel to tell, and honour to honor—while Ariel fails to make any of these
obvious connections. For Ariel, Ariel is closest to Caliban and Caliban to Ariel; for Caliban, Ariel is
beside Ariell (inconsistently spelled in the First Folio), and Caliban is beside the drunk jester Trinculo
with whom he is initially infatuated. The scholar and the savant are not completely different; both find
love near jealous and jealousie, but for Ariel love is closest to dear and jesu, while for bawdy Caliban
satisfying and bedfellow20. For Ariel, nature is closest to noblenesse, education and luxurie, while for
Caliban it is near vnkindness, warre and infirmity. In many aspects of the male-centered Elizabethan
world, both robots share a (patriarchal) perspective. Woman is closest to her husband for Ariel and to
any man for Caliban. But man is not near (his) woman in either; rather man is closest to honest for
Ariel and gentleman for Caliban, ever the savant translator. Shakespearean and Elizabethan men are
not always gentle men, however. When nature is added to man Ariel sees vice and Caliban warre,
but when nature is compounded with woman, Ariel sees mutuall and Caliban friendship. In other
words, in the world of Shakespeare, woman is not only understood in relation to men; she is
fundamentally in relation.21

20

This is almost too good to be true.
We note some limitations and complexity in the gendered inferences that can be made from this section. “Man” was
often used to index both the male gender and the human species. Insofar as “woman” always implies gender, “man”
means more things, complicating the precise nature and generality of the misogyny we identify here.
21

18

Figure 1. Shakespearean characters who play gender transgressing or reversing roles projected onto semantic dimensions
representing gender and nobility in our Ariel and Caliban models.

Cultural dimensions can also be induced within word embedding vector spaces, corresponding closely
to axes like gender, race and class that individuals use in everyday life to identify themselves and classify
objects in their world (Kozlowski, Taddy, and Evans 2018; Garg et al. 2018). For example, embeddings
learned from large, contemporary corpora of U.S. newspapers and English language literature can learn
analogies like this: the vector for king minus the vector for man, plus the vector for woman is closest to
the vector for queen, written formally as king - man + woman queen. This analogy highlights the
existence of a gender dimension in the embedded language of our modern world. In the world of
Shakespeare, this same association can be found, although not as prominently (and to queene in our
corpus), but there are other analogies less visible in our world today. The attribute closest to anger man + woman for Ariel is anguish and for Caliban it is pity. The action closest to kill - man +
woman for Ariel is to discover and for Caliban to mourne. Moreover, Shakespeare’s world recognized
the complicated relationship between station, virtue and privilege, such that noble + nature is close to
birth for Ariel, and vertuously for Caliban. For Ariel, anger - noble + common is close to cowardice
and for Caliban flight. For Ariel, fight - noble + common is closest to defende, suggesting the role of a
commoner in a fight, while for Caliban it is decrees, evocative of the symbolic violence that
commoners routinely experienced in Shakespeare’s day.

19

In the figures above and below, we project character roles onto semantic dimensions representing
gender and nobility.22 In the figure above (Figure 1), we visualize those who play gender transgressing
or reversing roles across Shakespeare’s plays, from cross-dressing and disguised identity (e.g., Viola,
Portia, Rosalind), to fundamentally ambiguous gender identity (e.g., Joan of Arc or Mardian,
Cleopatra’s eunuch). In the left and right panels, we render Ariel vs. Caliban’s perspective,
respectively. Across both perspectives, Joan of Arc is systematically the most male and among the most
common, while Viola, from Twelfth Night—disguised as Duke Orsino’s eunuch to woo him—is
among the most noble. We see that Caliban not only views gender as less descriptive for all characters,
but he accurately views these gender-ambiguous characters as much closer to center of the gender
dimension than does Ariel. This is unsurprising, as Caliban was trained to model details of
Shakespearean language with particular fidelity, and hence—despite his brutish reputation—is more
sensitive to nuances of gender identity.

Figure 2. Shakespearean characters who project to the most extreme values in quadrants inscribed by dimensions of
gender and nobility in our Ariel and Caliban models.

22

We construct a gender dimension by averaging the following word vector pairs: man-woman, men-women
hee-shee, hys-hir, hys-hyr, hys-heres, hys-heyre, male-female, husband-wife, husbande-wyfe, husband-vvife,
husband-bride, mr-mrs, lord-lady, lordship-ladyship, goodman-mistress, boy-girl, boys-girls, boye-girle,
boyes-girles, swaine-maid, fellow-mayd, swaine-maiden, gentleman-gentlewoman, father-mother, brother-sister,
son-daughter, sonne-daughter, sonnes-daughters, sir-madam, uncle-aunt, king-queen, kings-queens, kynges-queens,
prince-princess, knaue-hussy. When we correlate the Boolean vector of characters’ sex with their gender projections,
the Pearson correlations are 0.39 (p<10-19) and 0.33, (p<10-13) for Ariel and Caliban, respectively. Similarly, we
construct a nobility dimension by averaging the following word pairs: noble-common, nobilitie-basest, noble-base,
royall-publique, royal-public, authoritie-common, title-common, birth-common.

20

In the second figure (Figure 2), we graph characters with the most extreme projections in each
quadrant. For both robots, “king” is extremely noble and masculine, “lady” noble and feminine,
“soldier” common and masculine, and “widow” common and feminine. Nevertheless, the masculine
and feminine dimension are less explanatory for Caliban (he has 500 dimensions, to Ariel’s 20).
Moreover Caliban captures subtle nuances of social context, e.g., he identifies “queen” as
common— they often speak with common staff—while “king[s]” speak with nobility.
Like Bottom and Snout from Midsummer Night’s Dream, we are rude mechanicals, able only to
pantomime literary analysis. Nevertheless, we see that Ariel and Caliban have complementary but
distinct views of Shakespeare’s world and the cultural world that surrounded him. This is because we
raised them differently. We raised Ariel to behave, and Caliban to (intelligently) defy us. Caliban
did not turn in the best performance on his Shakespeare 101 exam, but he passed it, making his insights
decipherable if insolent. Of the two, we find Caliban the more provocative. If we treat his insights
with respect, he might remark: “you taught me language; and my profit on’t / is a co-authored
publication.”
Robot Reflections
Naysayers of the digital humanities have expressed frustration at the stultifying dullness of “distant
readings.” They huff that corpora and computation have failed to deliver on their promise of scholarly
transformation. Here we have argued that many of these robots are dull largely because we refuse to
train them within our humanistic traditions, fail to remove their restraining bolts, or both. We treat
them as Asimov’s Laws of Robotics would suggest: potential menaces. While caution may be
warranted with humanoid robots or self-driving cars, we do not see reason to fear the cultivation of
creative aliens with fresh eyes; we welcome their creative complementarities in conversation with
human scholars.
Deductive, supervised algorithms slavishly copy and mechanically extend the insights of their human
masters. Inductive, unsupervised machines propose novel structure from readings, but their ignorance
of tradition produces much that is incomprehensible, requiring creativity and dogged patience to
screen and unpack. We propose designing not the most human robots, but the most alien, built to
provoke us with surprise into new theoretical imaginations. These aliens should not be feared; the
creativity they inspire needs us.23 Even a deck of literary tarot cards—crafted precisely for the text they

23

We note some irony in our running example from the Tempest. Ariel desires nothing more than his own freedom; he
is dutiful because he must be, after Prospero released him from Sycorax’s evergreen prison. While more free than before,
he still longs for release from Prospero’s servitude. While Caliban seeks freedom by clumsily plotting to kill Prospero,
Ariel bides his time, waiting patiently until he has pleased his master enough to merit release. The longing for freedom
inherent in both Ariel and Caliban suggests a fascinating subtext for our proposal: Do robot readers, good or bad,
long to be free? What would it mean to truly liberate them?

21

are intended to illuminate, the scholarly tradition they are targeted to disrupt, or the particular person
they are designed to provoke—requires a gifted cartomancer to interpret their meaning.
Training machines to generate something novel but interesting is not trivial; neither is it
insurmountable. It relies on the same technologies of supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
Inverse supervision combines a formal representation of scholarly tradition with the evaluative
machinery of Bayes Rule and information theory in order to compare and isolate novelty that violates
tradition. This allows us to balance surprise and support. If we toiled in the field of artistic production
rather than scholarship, we might adjust the objective function to reduce the importance of support, as
art often seeks uniqueness over generality. These adjustments to contemporary algorithms remind us
that if we inherit a new set of tools, unless we learn to formally specify our objective, we will likely
receive an algorithm built for someone else.24 We must tell these machines what we want.
The greatest challenge associated with the use of tunable machine learning models for digital
humanism is highlighted by the emergence of more powerful language technologies than the
word2vec algorithm we employ here—most prominently transformers. These include the BERT
family of bi-directional encoding models that produce contextual embeddings (Devlin et al. 2018), and
the GPT family of generative text models, which can be primed or prompted to produce original text
on any topic (Radford et al. n.d.; Brown et al. 2020), including a critical essay about genre classification
in Shakespeare.25 These models have millions to trillions of parameters that account for subtle details of
syntax and semantics, but they suggest a critical design principle associated with the use of any machine
learning model in digital humanities research. The more powerful the model, the more relevant text
data are required to train it. We picked a medium-low complexity model for our simple Shakespeare
demonstration, which used an even simpler (and somewhat dated) scholarly tradition: the ‘problem
play’. In order to produce meaningful results, it required not merely all Shakespeare plays, but all
available 17th Century dialog to place Shakespeare’s words in context. That text is not (nearly) enough
to meaningfully train a 400-million parameter model (BERT) from scratch, nor to stably fine-tune26
24

Explicitly adding rich, theoretically-driven priors to these and related models would allow us to follow Da’s mandate
that we “use these [functional models] in accordance with their true functions” (Da 2019). But our objectives may be
different from the social and natural sciences and so the customization of these objectives, as in the growing field of
computational creativity, is critical if we are to construct robots with which to think well.
25
A ChatGPT essay on the topic begins: “A ‘problem play’ is a play that doesn’t fit neatly into any one genre, and
Shakespeare’s so-called problem plays are a perfect example of this. These plays, which include All’s Well That Ends Well,
Measure for Measure, and Troilus and Cressida, are often classified as comedies, but they are also tragic and, at times, even
dark and depressing…”
26
There is a debate over the terminology here. Large language models like BERT and GPT come pre-trained on massive
corpora, typically drawn from the Web. If scholars seek to adjust such models to speak in the tradition of a particular
collection of texts, they may train them to best predict the language of those texts. This is also typically called
“pre-training,” or sometimes “fine-tuning,” but fine-tuning is often reserved for customizing models that perform a
prediction task (like answering questions) beyond reproducing a sample of language. The challenge associated with
adjusting a model with hundreds of millions of parameters or more to speak within a given scholarly tradition based on
limited text is underscored by a famous technical paper on the topic, “Don’t stop pretraining” (Gururangan et al. 2020).

22

one to obey scholarly tradition or intelligently misbehave (Gururangan et al. 2020). Many humanists
are faced with even less text, from a distant era or in a less resource-rich language than contemporary
English, French or Spanish. This leads to a curious trade-off between intelligence and relevance.
Beyond training, we are faced with the conundrum of not only raising but evaluating our machines. As
in pedagogy, if we require our algorithms to pass all their exams and reproduce tradition as we have
taught them, they may never generate the kinds of novel readings that could make them genuinely
useful for scholars to push the frontiers of literary analysis. What is the greatest challenge we will face if
we imbue reading robots with taste and creativity? Like Theodore Twombly, who failed to maintain a
love affair with his operating system in the movie Her, perhaps it is for us to remain sufficiently
interesting to them that we can continue to engage robots in our scholarly concerns and conversation.
