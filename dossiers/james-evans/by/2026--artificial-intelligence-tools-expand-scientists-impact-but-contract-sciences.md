ABSTRACT
Development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has accelerated scientific discovery1 . Alongside recent AI-oriented Nobel
prizes2–9 , these trends establish the role of AI tools in science10 . This advancement raises questions about the
potential influences of AI tools on scientists and science as a whole, and highlights a potential conflict between
individual and collective benefits11 . To evaluate, we used a pretrained language model to identify AI-augmented
research, with an F1-score of 0.875 in validation against expert-labeled data. Using a dataset of 41.3 million research
papers across natural science and covering distinct eras of AI, here we show an accelerated adoption of AI tools
among scientists and consistent professional advantages associated with AI usage, but a collective narrowing of
scientific focus. Scientists who engage in AI-augmented research publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84
times more citations, and become research project leaders 1.37 years earlier than those who do not. By contrast, AI
adoption shrinks the collective volume of scientific topics studied by 4.63% and decreases scientist’s engagement
with one another by 22.00%. Thereby, AI adoption in science presents a seeming paradox—an expansion of individual
scientists’ impact but a contraction in collective science’s reach—as AI-augmented work moves collectively toward
areas richest in data. With reduced follow-on engagement, AI tools appear to automate established fields rather than
explore new ones, highlighting a tension between personal advancement and collective scientific progress.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent decades, promising to impact myriad aspects of society,
including education12,13 , healthcare14,15 , and industry16 . Major investments in predictive and generative AI have catalyzed
society-level debates over the future of AI at home and in the workplace. Perhaps more than any other domain, AI tools have
become deeply entwined with the process of knowledge production, yielding findings that attract disproportionate attention in
various scientific fields1 . For example, AlphaFold learns known protein structures to accurately predict the unexplored ones,
circumventing the capital and human cost of conventional structural inference and recently granted a 2024 Nobel Prize9,17 .
Models improved via deep reinforcement learning have become tuned to contain complex fusion reactions18 and discovered new,
hardware-optimized forms to matrix multiplication that recursively accelerate deep learning itself19 . Autonomous laboratory
systems driven by ChatGPT have helped some chemists and material scientists upscale the number of adaptive high-throughput
experiments20–22 . Moreover, recent developments in large language models are making them increasingly incorporated in
assisting scientific writing23–26 , facilitating the distillation of scientific findings, but also raising concerns about weakened
confidence in AI-generated content21,22,27 . AI’s increasing capabilities to influence scientific research suggest that it manifests
potential to both increase the productivity of individual scientists and raise the visibility of science it supports.
Despite the increasing adoption of AI in science, large-scale empirical measurements of AI’s scientific impact are limited,
and a detailed, dynamic understanding of AI’s impact on the entire character of science remains largely unknown. Recent work
suggests AI has brought widespread benefits to individual scientists but may lead to demographic disparity resulting from gaps
in AI education10 . Researchers have also identified evolving citation patterns that signal a changing scientific landscape in AI
research28 . Here we seek to explore the impact of AI in scientific research at different scales by posing the question: How does
the adoption of AI influence individual scientists’ careers and the collective exploration of science as a whole?
We conduct a large-scale quantitative analysis of the impact of AI on scientists and science, covering 41,298,433 research
papers spanning from 1980 to 2025 in the OpenAlex dataset29 , with patterns corroborated using the Web of Science30,31 .

Notably, we do not focus on computer science or mathematics, fields that develop AI methodologies directly, but rather on
papers that augment research in natural science fields by adopting AI, primarily covering decades involving development and
deployment of conventional machine learning algorithms and also extending to a necessarily more preliminary analysis of the
latest generative AI techniques. Specifically, we select six representative disciplines that cover the vast majority of natural
science contributions—biology, medicine, chemistry, physics, materials science, and geology. We then leverage the BERT
language model32,33 to accurately identify such AI-augmented research papers based on their titles and abstracts.
We separate the periods in which AI was predominantly conventional machine learning, deep learning, and most recently
generative designs including large language models. With abundant data-based evidence across decades of conventional
machine learning and deep learning, we validate these AI-based measurements and use them to reveal that the adoption of AI
leads to an amplifying effect on the career of individual scientists, bringing acceleration in the production and visibility of
science produced by those scientists who incorporate AI. Nevertheless, this effect corresponds with a contracted focus within
collective science. Measured with “knowledge extent”, the “diameter” covered by a sampled batch of papers in vector space,
AI-driven science spans less topical ground and is associated with a decrease in follow-on scientific engagement, suggesting that
AI is currently more likely to focus on existing popular research problems rather than explore new ones. Meanwhile, analyses
using currently available data within the latest era of generative AI including large language models reveal a preliminary
consistency with prior periods, providing a starting point for further study as generative AI develops over a longer period.

Results
Increasing prevalence of AI in science
In this investigation, we focus on research papers using AI methods in various fields of natural science, where we conduct our
analysis based on 41,298,433 papers from the OpenAlex dataset29 , covering six representative disciplines: biology, chemistry,
geology, materials science, medicine, and physics (Methods M1). According to the invention of milestone technologies
in the trend of AI development, we divide the past decades into three eras, namely machine learning (ML), deep learning
(DL), and generative AI (GAI) (Methods M2). To identify AI papers in various fields across eras, we fine-tune BERT32,33 ,
an established language model34–36 , on articles published in explicitly AI-oriented scientific journals and conferences for
automatically extracting and interpreting information from context. Specifically, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process to
adapt the pre-trained BERT model to the task of AI paper identification. We first independently train two models based on titles
and abstracts of papers, respectively, then ensemble the optimized individual models to identify all selected papers (Fig. 1a,
Methods M3, and Extended Data Fig. 1). This approach eliminates the need for manual selection of AI-related trigger words,
as demonstrated in previous research28 .
To evaluate the accuracy of our identification, we recruited a team of human experts to validate these results (Methods M4
and Extended Data Fig. 2). The experts demonstrate strong consensus across their independent annotation of papers sampled at
random from the six disciplines mentioned above, achieving an average Fleiss’ Kappa (κ) of 0.96437,38 . The BERT model
attains an F1-score of 0.875 in an evaluation that uses the expert labels as ground truth. Meanwhile, the strong consensus among
experts and high quality for identification is consistent across samples from different eras of AI, confirming the reliability of our
identification accuracy and laying a robust foundation for our subsequent analysis (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1-S4).
To provide a rationale and explainability for our identification results, we visualize attention strengths in the BERT model
with examples, where the model allocates substantial attention to terms such as “neural network” and “large language model”,
illustrating how the model correctly interprets and accurately identifies AI-related contents from papers published in different
era of AI development (Supplementary Fig. S2-S3).
In total, we identify 310,957 AI-augmented papers, comprising 0.75% of all selected papers. Semantically, the identified AIrelated papers turn out to be around topics combining artificial intelligence and conventional research topics across disciplines
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Counting all eras and disciplines collectively, the most commonly adopted AI methods in natural
science research include support vector machines and principal component analysis from the ML era, and convolutional neural
networks and generative adversarial networks from the DL era. The large language model, which has emerged in recent years,
also ranks among the most frequently utilized methods (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table S5-S11). Statistically, despite the
overall rise in the number of papers published annually across all disciplines39 , the share of AI-augmented papers surged by
10.70 (geology, Z = 348.60, p < 0.001 and d f = 1 in Cochran-Armitage test) to 51.89 (biology, Z = 1388.70, p < 0.001 and
d f = 1 in Cochran-Armitage test) times from 1980 to 2025 (Fig. 1d). Similarly, the proportion of researchers adopting AI
has grown even more rapidly, from 135.46 times in geology (Z = 546.81, p < 0.001 and d f = 1 in Cochran-Armitage test)
to 362.16 in physics (Z = 2237.51, p < 0.001 and d f = 1 in Cochran-Armitage test) (Fig. 1e). Meanwhile, growth rates for
AI-augmented papers and researchers have accelerated across the three eras (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. S5-S6). These
findings underscore the increasing prevalence and fast development of AI in science across all disciplines and the importance of
understanding AI’s impact on scientific research and progress.

AI enhances individual scientists
From statistics across 27,405,011 papers with intact reference records in the OpenAlex dataset, we note that from the publication
date of each paper until decades later, annual citations to AI papers are 98.70% higher than non-AI papers on average (Fig. 2a,
t ≥ 8.33, p < 0.001 and d f > 103 in t-test on any year). In addition to higher annual average citations, the higher scientific
impact of AI-augmented papers is also reflected by multiple alternative statistical indicators about top and bottom annual
citation count (Supplementary Fig. S8). Also, AI papers published at different eras consistently receive more citations (Extended
Data Fig. 3, t ≥ 4.06, p < 0.001 and d f > 103 in t-test on any era). Furthermore, we examine the distribution of AI-augmented
papers across journals of varying Journal Citation Report (JCR) quantiles40 (Supplementary Fig. S14). We find that the
proportion of AI papers in Q1 journals is 18.60% higher than non-AI ones in all journals, and in Q2 journals, the AI proportion
is 1.59% higher, while Q3 and Q4 journals hold a relatively lower proportion of papers with AI (χ 2 = 3629.11, p < 0.001
and d f = 3 in χ 2 -test). These results indicate a heterogeneous distribution of AI-augmented papers across journals, with a
higher prevalence in high-impact journals. Paralleled by the attention paid to AI papers, the impact of AI researchers also
substantially increases. On average, researchers adopting AI annually publish 3.02 times more papers (t ≥ 47.18, p < 0.001
and d f > 103 in t-test on any discipline) and garner 4.84 times more citations (t ≥ 30.32, p < 0.001 and d f > 103 in t-test on
any discipline) compared with those not adopting AI, with consistency across disciplines and robustness for core researchers
with multi-year continuous publication records41 (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S17). Furthermore,
when controlling for and comparing scientists with similar early-career positions, the enhanced productivity and impact still
hold (Supplementary Fig. S16). This suggests that, after accounting for potential selection-biases among researchers with

bars, with the insets of panel (a) centred at the 1% and 10% percentiles and other panels centred at the mean. All statistical tests

different original achievements that may influence their choice of AI adoption, AI itself contributes to the observed advantages.
To identify the implications of AI adoption on scientist’s career development, we classify the scientists into “junior” and
“established”, where junior scientists are defined as newcomers who have not yet led a research project, whereas established
scientists refer to those who have led one or more research projects (Methods M5 and Extended Data Fig. 5). We extract
2,282,029 career trajectories of scientists from the dataset, each initially identified as a junior scientist (Methods M6). The
results reveal that AI-augmented research is associated with reduced research team sizes, averaging 1.33 (19.29%) fewer
scientists (t = 20.47, p < 0.001 and d f > 103 in t-test, Extended Data Fig. 6). Specifically, the average number of junior
scientists decreased from 2.89 in non-AI teams to 1.99 (31.14%) in AI teams (t = 19.02, p < 0.001 and d f > 103 in t-test),
while the number of established scientists decreased from 4.01 to 3.58 (10.77%) in AI teams (t = 20.82, p < 0.001 and
d f > 103 in t-test). This indicates that AI adoption primarily contributes to a reduction in the number of junior scientists in
teams, while decrease in the number of established scientists is relatively moderate. Given the decline in the number of junior
scientists, we further calculate the probability of junior scientists becoming established scientists or leaving academia (Fig. 2c).
Across all studied disciplines, the probability for AI-adopted junior scientists to transition to established scientists is 45.00%,
13.64% higher than for their counterparts who do not adopt AI (t ≥ 1.40, p < 0.2 and d f = 90 in t-test on 4 out of 6 disciplines).
This indicates that AI-adopted scientists are associated with increased opportunities to lead research projects and reduced risks
of dropping out from academia, thereby experiencing accelerated career transitions from junior to established scientists.
4/82

To further quantify this effect, we measure the accelerated career development of junior scientists by employing a birth-death
model42 and fitting the model parameter λ with scientists’ career trajectories (Fig. 2d and Methods M7). We find that the
anticipated transition time to becoming established scientists is 1.37 years shorter for AI-adopted junior scientists compared to
their counterparts. The expectation of transition time is 7.33 years for junior scientists adopting AI (R2 = 0.995) and 8.70 years
for those without (R2 = 0.987). This demonstrates how AI adoption affords junior scientists opportunities to lead research
projects and become established earlier. Further analysis reveals that this reduction in the transition time for AI-adopted junior
scientists to become established ones is universal across examined disciplines (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, the established
scientists involved in AI papers are, on average, 10.77% younger than those in non-AI papers (Extended Data Fig. 6, t ≥ 2.12,
p < 0.05, and d f > 103 in t-test on most year). Collectively, these findings suggest that AI research receives more attention
from academia, and AI-adopting scientists are associated with higher scholarly productivity and impact. In this way, they
become established scientists with higher probability and at earlier ages, experiencing accelerated career development.

embed research papers into a 768-dimensional vector space with a pre-trained text embedding model, then measure the
knowledge extent of papers within that space. (b) For visualization, we use the t-SNE algorithm to flatten the high-dimensional
embeddings of a random batch of 10,000 papers, half of which are AI papers and half are non-AI papers, into a 2-D plot. As
shown by the solid arrows and circular boundaries, the knowledge extent of AI papers (calculated in the unflatted space) is
smaller across the entirety of natural science, and AI papers are more clustered in knowledge space, indicating more
concentration on specific problems. (c) Knowledge extent of AI and non-AI papers in each field (p < 0.001, n = 1, 000 samples

AI contracts science’s focus
The accelerating use of AI in science and its impact on individual scientists raises questions about its influences across the
entire scientific field. To evaluate how AI collectively impacts the frontiers of scientific exploration, we design a measurement
5/82

to characterize the breadth of scholarly attention represented by a collection of research papers. We employ SPECTER 2.0, a
specialized text embedding model pre-trained on a large scientific literature corpus and fine-tuned with citation information36 ,
to project research articles onto this 768-dimensional embedding space of science (Fig. 3a).
Within the high-dimensional embedding space, we design the measurement of knowledge extent (KE), which is the
“diameter” of vector space covered by a sampled batch of papers, which allows us to compare the coverage of topical ground
between AI and non-AI papers in each given domain43,44 (Fig. 3b and Methods M8). Compared to conventional research, AI
research is associated with a 4.63% contracted median collective knowledge extent across science, which is consistent across
all six disciplines (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8, χ 2 ≥ 84.05, p < 0.001 and d f = 1 in median-test on any discipline).
Moreover, when dividing these disciplines into more than two hundred sub-fields, the contraction of knowledge extent can
be observed in more than 70% of sub-fields (Extended Data Fig. 9). When we compare the median entropy of knowledge
distribution between AI and non-AI research in each domain (Fig. 3d), results demonstrate that the knowledge distribution of AI
research has an lower entropy (χ 2 ≥ 79.20, p < 0.001 and d f = 1 in median-test on any discipline), indicating an increasingly
disproportionate focus on specific problems rather than across entire fields.
Generally, these results highlight an emerging conflict between individual and collective incentives to adopt AI in science,
where scientists receive expanded personal reach and impact, but the knowledge extent of entire scientific fields tends to shrink
and focus attention on a subset of topical areas. According to analyses on possible factors that may influence the selectivity of
AI adoption across different topics, we find that factors like inherent topicality, original impact, and funding priority, remain
almost unrelated to the disproportionate AI adoption (Supplementary Fig. S22-S24). In contrast, data availability appears to
be a major impacting factor, where areas with an abundance of data are increasingly and disproportionately amenable to AI
research, contributing to the observed concentration within knowledge space (Supplementary Fig. S25).
AI reduces scientific engagement
In order to analyze mechanisms underlying the conflict between the growing influence of individual papers and researchers and
the narrowing of domain knowledge within AI research, we examine the relationship between articles that cite AI and non-AI
work. We first examine the knowledge extent of “paper families”, i.e., a focal paper and its follow-on citations, which measures
the size of the space covered by research derived from each original paper (Fig. 4a and Methods M9). Results show that the
knowledge extent of AI papers’ citation families is on average 3.46% more expanded compared to non-AI papers’ (t ≥ 1.91,
p ≤ 0.1 and d f > 103 in t-test on 30 out of 32 pairs of data). Therefore, the contraction of knowledge space in AI research is
not attributable to the narrowing of knowledge space that can be derived from each original research work.
To further investigate, we examine relationships between papers by measuring the degree of follow-on paper engagement,
namely how frequently citations of the same original paper cite each other (Fig. 4b and Methods M10). Results demonstrate AI
research spawns 22.00% less follow-on engagement (t ≥ 8.10, p < 0.001 and d f > 103 in t-test on any discipline), suggesting
that AI papers tend to only concentrate on the original paper, rather than forming dense interactions among each other, which
is the characteristic of emerging fields45 . This results in a star-like structure around specific popular research topics, rather
than a network of emergent and interconnected research works. Further evidence of this concentration is found in the Matthew
effect46 among AI paper citations across different fields (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 10). In AI research, a small number of
superstar papers dominate the field, with 22.20% of top papers receiving 80% of the citations and the top 54.14% receiving
95% of citations. This unequal distribution leads to a GINI coefficient of 0.754 in citation patterns surrounding AI research,
higher than 0.690 for non-AI papers (t = 27.86, p < 0.001 and d f = 198 in t-test), signaling a disparity in recognition.
To further analyze the impact of reduced follow-on engagement, we sample 590,325,130 pairs of papers, where each pair
cites the same original work. Among these, 51,723,984 pairs not only cite the same original work but also cite each other
(engaged), while the remaining pairs do not cite each other (disengaged). We examine distances between these pairs of papers
within the 768-dimensional vector space (Fig. 4d) and find that median distance between paper pairs disengaged from one
another tends to be 18.11% larger than between paper pairs engaged with each other. In contrast, the closest disengaged
paper pairs are 76.51% closer to one another than the closest paper pairs engaged with one another. Taken together, a pair of
disengaged papers commonly focus on less related topics and lie farther apart in the embedding space. Occasionally, however,
due to the lack of reciprocal engagement, it is possible that mutually-unaware papers lie very close to each other, which
indicates more overlapping research. These findings suggest that AI in science has become more concentrated around popular
research topics that become “lonely crowds” with reduced interaction among papers, linking to more overlapping research and
a contraction in knowledge extent and diversity across science.

Discussion
In this study, we perform a large-scale empirical measurement of the effect of adopting AI in science on both individual
scientists and scientific communities. We identify three waves of AI adoptions in science, corresponding with the dominance
of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models. Each wave is marked with an accelerated AI adoption rate

individual AI and non-AI paper families, i.e., an original paper and its cumulative citations (n = 27, 405, 011), where the

pairs that cite the same prior research, with or without citing one another—engaged versus disengaged (n = 590, 325, 130

distance is smaller, indicating a higher probability of overlapping in knowledge space. For all panels, 99% CIs are shown as

in research papers and authors. We find that individual scientists are increasingly rewarded with expanded academic impact
and accelerated career development for incorporating AI assistance in research across these waves and in all natural science
research fields we studied. On average, the use of AI helps individual scientists publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84
times more citations, and become team leaders 1.37 years earlier. This substantial academic benefit may be a driving force
behind the accelerated rate of AI adoption. However, we also find unintended consequences from the increased prevalence of
AI-augmented research. In all fields, AI-augmented research focuses on a narrower scope of scientific topics and reduces the
scientific engagement of follow-on research, leading to more overlapping research works that slows the expansion of knowledge.
Further, with a greater concentration of collective attention to the same AI papers, the adoption of AI appears to induce authors
to engage in collective hill-climbing1 , catalyzing solutions to known problems rather than creating new ones.
These findings raise critical questions for science policy. What are the topics most likely left behind from AI-augmented
research across fields? Those with less available data include critical scientific questions regarding the origins of natural
phenomena, where data are necessarily reduced. Accelerating scientific activity “under the lamp post” of highly visible,
data-rich phenomena moves science away from many foundational questions and towards operational ones. By driving attention
toward the most popular new developments, AI appears to drive problem solution over generation. These issues become
particularly concerning in the face of calls to further increase support for AI-augmented science47,48 , coupled with the personal
1 The metaphor of “collective hill-climbing” describes a situation where researchers act like a group of climbers all scaling the same popular mountain from
the same route. Because both the “path” of a known approach and the “peak” of an anticipated solution are constrained, this collective rush leads to “crowding”
and may discourage the search for other, potentially higher “mountains” representing new questions and answers.

scientific incentives we demonstrate. This could shift collective attention away from new and original questions that lack
the data required for AI to demonstrate benefit. It is true that more overlapping attention and a contracted focus may benefit
scientific replication and extension, accelerating the emergence of solid and practical solutions to specific questions. Insofar
as scientific discovery represents a vast and complex landscape, however, concentrating attention on the same developments
may increase the likelihood that science becomes fixed on local maxima of scientific explanation and prediction rather than
searching in a more broad, decoupled, and diverse way.
While our analysis provides new insight into AI’s impact on science, clear limitations remain. Our identification approach,
though validated by experts, misses subtle and unmentioned forms of AI use, and our focus on natural sciences excludes
important domains where AI adoption patterns may differ. Moreover, despite consistently suggestive evidence, we cannot fully
identify the causal linkage between AI adoption and scientific impact. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that currently
attributed uses of AI in science primarily augment cognitive tasks through data processing and pattern recognition. Looking
forward, these findings illuminate a critical and expansive pathway for AI development in science. To preserve collective
exploration in an era of AI use, we will need to reimagine AI systems that expand not only cognitive capacity but also sensory
and experimental capacity49,50 , enabling scientists to search, select, and gather new types of data from previously inaccessible
domains rather than merely optimizing analysis of standing data. The history of major discoveries has been most consistently
linked with new views on nature51 . Expanding the scope of AI’s deployment in science will be required for sustained scientific
research and to stimulate new fields rather than merely automate existing ones.

Methods
M1. Dataset and Paper selection
In this section, we introduce the procedure of selecting the research papers included in our analysis. In this paper, we
conduct our major analyses based on OpenAlex29 . OpenAlex is a scientific research database built upon the foundation of the
Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)52,53 . Supported by non-profit organizations, OpenAlex is continuously updated, providing
a sustainable global resource for research information. As of March 2025, OpenAlex contains 265.7M research papers, along
with related data about citation, author, institution, etc. Among the massive quantity of papers in the OpenAlex dataset, we
select 66,117,158 English research papers published in journals and conferences spanning from 1980 to 2025 and filter out those
with incomplete titles or abstracts. We identify the scientific discipline each paper belongs to utilizing the topics contained in
OpenAlex, which are extracted using a natural language processing approach that annotates titles and abstracts with Wikipedia
article titles as topics sharing textual similarity. In the raw dataset, these topics form a hierarchical structure and each paper is
associated with several. Adopting the 19 basic scientific disciplines in the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)52,53 , i.e., art,
biology, business, chemistry, computer science, economics, engineering, environmental science, geography, geology, history,
materials science, mathematics, medicine, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, and sociology, we trace along
the hierarchy to determine to which disciplines each topic belongs. We note that because the original topics of one paper
may be retraced to different topics, the scientific discipline of each paper may not be unique. In other words, one paper may
span two or more academic disciplines, e.g., chemistry and biology, which reflects the common phenomena of borderline or
interdisciplinary research54 .
In this paper, we emphasize the adoption of AI methods in conventional natural science disciplines and exclude research
developing AI methodologies themselves, separating the influence of AI on science from AI’s own invention and refinement.
Therefore, we select biology, medicine, chemistry, physics, materials science, and geology as representatives of natural science
disciplines, while we exclude computer science and mathematics, where most works introducing and developing AI methods are
published. We also exclude art, business, economics, history, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology, in order
to focus on how AI is changing the natural sciences and career trajectories in the sciences. Our 6 natural science disciplines
include the majority of OpenAlex articles, resulting in 41,298,433 papers, containing 18,392,040 in biology, 4,209,771 in
chemistry, and 2,380,666 in geology, 4,755,717 in materials science, 24,315,342 in medicine, 5,138,488 in physics. The
selected disciplines cover various dimensions of natural science, representing an broad view of scientific research as a whole.
M2. Divide three stages of AI development
We divide the history of AI development into three key eras: the traditional machine learning (ML) era (1980–2014), the
deep learning (DL) era (2015–2022), and the generative (GAI) era (2023–present). We consider 1980 as the start of the
traditional machine learning era because several landmark researches were published in the 1980s, such as the back-propagating
method55,56 . We regard that the deep learning era began in 2015, as marked by breakthroughs including ResNet, which enabled
the training of ultra-deep neural networks, revolutionizing fields including computer vision and speech recognition57 . Finally,
we divide the GAI era to begin in 2023 with the publication of ChatGPT, a representative large language model, in December
2022, which saw the advent of large-scale transformer-based models capable of strong generalized performance across a wide
range of tasks, sparking new applications in natural language processing and beyond. Each of these transitions was driven by
8/82

advances in algorithms, computational power, and data availability, substantially expanding the capabilities and scope of AI for
science.
M3. Design and fine-tune the language model for AI paper identification
Insofar as both a paper’s title and the abstract contain important information about its content, we independently train two
separate models based on paper titles and abstracts, and then integrate the two models into an ensembled one by averaging their
outputs. The structure of our NLP model for paper identification consists of two parts. The backbone network is a 12-layer
BERT model with 12 attention heads in each layer, and the sequence classification head is a linear layer with a 2-dimensional
output atop the BERT output. We normalize the 2-dimensional output with a softmax function and obtain the probability that
the paper involves AI-assistance. We utilize the BERT model named “bert-base-uncased” from Hugging Face58 , which is
pre-trained with a large-scale general corpus, and set the maximum length of tokenization to be 16 for titles and 256 for abstracts.
We design a two-stage fine-tuning process with training and validation sets, which we extracted from the OpenAlex dataset,
to transfer the pre-trained model to our paper identification task. The construction of positive and negative data is different
between the two stages. In both stages, we randomly split the positive and negative data into 90% and 10% to correspondingly
obtain training and validation sets. We use the training set for model training and employ the validation set to select the optimal
model. Because the numbers of positive and negative cases are unbalanced, we use the bootstrap sample technique on positive
cases to balance its number with negative cases at both stages.
In the first stage, we construct relatively coarse positive data, only considering eight typical AI journals and conferences, i.e.,
Nature Machine Intelligence, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Machine Learning Research, International
Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), AAAI Conference on
Artificial Intelligence, and International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI). Among the papers belonging to our
chosen 6 disciplines, we extract all papers published in these venues as positive cases and randomly sample 1% of the remaining
papers in our six chosen natural science fields as negative cases, resulting in 26,165 positive and 291,035 negative data. We
fine-tune the pre-trained model for 30 epochs on the training set and select the optimal model according to the F1-score on the
validation set.
In the second stage, we construct more precise positive data based on the obtained optimal model in the first stage. We
identify papers in the whole OpenAlex dataset and aggregate the results for each venue, obtaining the probability for each
venue across OpenAlex to be an AI venue by averaging the AI probability for all papers within it. We then select the venues
with > 80% AI probability and > 100 papers as AI venues. We also incorporate venues with “machine learning” or “artificial
intelligence” in their names. In papers belonging to our 6 chosen disciplines, we extract all papers published in the selected
AI venues as positive cases and randomly sample 1% of those remaining as negative cases, resulting in 31,311 positive and
231,258 negative cases. Then, we fine-tune the obtained optimal model in the first stage for another 30 epochs with the new
training set and select the best model according to F1-score on the new validation set. Finally, we utilize optimal ensemble
models during both stages to identify all papers that use AI to support natural science research from the selected representative
natural science disciplines.
M4. Scrutinize our identification results by disciplinary experts
We arbitrarily sample 220 papers (110 papers × 2 groups) from each of the 6 disciplines, resulting in 12 paper groups in total.
We enlisted 12 experts with abundant AI research experience (Supplementary Table S1) and assigned 3 different groups of
papers to each. Without revealing the identification results obtained with the BERT model, we queried our experts whether each
paper was an AI paper. In this way, each paper is repeatedly labeled by three distinct experts, and we evaluate the consistency
among these experts based on Fleiss’ Kappa coefficient (κ)37,38 , which is an unsupervised measurement for assessing the
agreement between independent raters. Having confirmed consensus among our experts, we draw the final expert label of
each paper from the three experts according to the principle of the minority obeying the majority. We regard the expert
labels as ground truth and validate the result of our BERT model against it with the F1-Score, which is a supervised accuracy
measurement of accuracy.
M5. Determine the project leader of papers
Here, we define the project leader as the last author of a research paper, in alignment with conventions established by previous
studies59 . To ensure that in most papers, the last authors represent the project leader, we examine the fraction of papers that list
authors following alphabetical order. First, we directly traverse all selected papers and obtain that the prevalence of papers
listing authors in alphabetical order, which ranges from 14.87% in materials science to 22.15% in geology. Nevertheless, it is
difficult to distinguish whether these papers are really intended to list the authors in alphabetical order or the list of authors
according to their roles, which just happen to unintentionally fall in alphabetical order. The latter situation is more likely
to occur when there are fewer authors, i.e., two or three. To tackle this analytical challenge, we determine the fraction of
“unintended” alphabetical author lists through a Monte Carlo method. We generate 10 randomly shuffled copies of the author
9/82

list for each paper and obtained that from 13.82% (materials science, standard deviation σ = 0.02) to 20.28% (geology, standard
deviation σ = 0.03) papers have alphabetically listed authors among the random author lists. This indicates the proportion of
“unintended” alphabetical author lists, and we can derive the actual fraction of papers with intentionally alphabetical author lists
by the difference between the above two sets of statistical results. The actual fraction obtained illustrates that only 1.58% of
papers across all disciplines intentionally list the authors in alphabetical order (Supplementary Table S12), and therefore, we
can, with negligible interference, assume that we can identify last authors as team leaders.
M6. Detect scientists’ career role transition
The OpenAlex dataset incorporates a well-designed Author Name Disambiguation (AND) mechanism29 , which utilizes an
XGBoost model60 to predict the likelihood that two authors are the same based on features like their institutions, co-authors,
and citations, and then applies a custom, ORCID-anchored clustering process to group their works, assigning a unique ID for
each author. Simply utilizing unique IDs, we are able to track a large number of authors at the same time61 , where we depict
an individual scientist’s career trajectory using a role transition model (Extended Data Fig. 4a) and extract the role transition
trajectories for scientists.
First, we traverse all selected papers in the 6 disciplines and extract all the scientists involved in any of these papers. Then,
for each individual scientist, we extract all papers in which they have been involved and record the time of their first publication
in any role, the time of their first publication as team leader (if ever), and the time of their last publication. Subsequently, we
filter out scientists whose publication records span only a single year. We also filter out those who directly start as established
scientists leading research teams without a role transition from junior scientists. Finally, we detect the time that each scientist
abandons academic publishing. Considering that one scientist may not publish papers continuously every year, we cannot
regard them as having left academia based on their absence in the published record for a single year. Therefore, we follow the
settings in previous research62 to use a threshold of 3 years and regard scientists who have no more publications after 2022 as
having exited academia, while those who still publish papers after 2022 are considered to have an unclear ultimate status and
are excluded from analysis. Finally, we obtain 2,282,029 scientists in the 6 disciplines with complete role transition trajectories.
We also classify them into AI and non-AI scientists according to whether they have published AI-augmented papers.
Moreover, by analyzing author contribution statements collected in previous studies63,64 , we further validate our detection
results by examining changes in scientists’ self-reported contributions throughout their careers (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Results
indicate that junior scientists primarily engage in a large proportion of technical tasks, such as conducting experiments and
analyzing data, and less in conceptual tasks, such as conceiving ideas and writing papers. Nevertheless, the proportion of
conceptual work significantly rises (p < 0.01 and d f = 1 in Cochran-Armitage test) during their tenure as junior scientists,
reaching saturation at a high level (60% or more) upon transition to becoming established scientists. This finding validates our
definition of role-transition by demonstrating a shift in the nature of scientists’ contributions from participating in research
projects to leading them.
M7. Estimate the birth-death model for career development of junior scientists
To obtain a more precise quantification of how much AI accelerates the career development of junior scientists, we employ a
general birth-death model42 . This type of stochastic process model depicts the dynamic evolution of a population as members
join and exit. In our context, it models the role transitions of junior scientists. Specifically, we use two separate birth-death
models for junior scientists who eventually become established and those who leave academia, respectively. Here, “birth”
processes refer to the entry of junior scientists into academia, and “death” processes symbolize their transition out of the junior
stage, either by becoming established scientists or quitting academia. Because the entry and exit of each junior scientist are
independent from one another, we use Poisson processes to model “birth” (entry) and “death” (exit) events, respectively.
The Poisson process is a typical stochastic process model for describing the occurrence of random events that are independent
of each other65 . The mathematical formula of the Poisson process is:
P(N(t0 ) = k) =

(λ0t0 )k −λ0 t0
e
,t0 > 0, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
k!

(1)

where N(t0 ) denotes the number of random events that happened before time t0 , and λ0 is the parameter of the Poisson process,
depicting the happening rate of random events. We consider a birth-death model where birth and death dynamics are both
Poisson processes, and rate parameters are µ and ω, respectively. Through mathematical derivation66 , we conclude that the
duration time t from birth to death follows an exponential distribution with the parameter ω − µ, where the exact form of the
probability density function is:
P(t) = (ω − µ)e−(ω−µ)t ,t > 0.

(2)
10/82

We consider the difference between the two rate parameters ω − µ as a whole and fit it with a single parameter λ . Then, the
transition time for junior scientists to become established scientists or leave academia follows the exponential distribution:
P(t) = λ e−λt ,t > 0,

(3)

and the corresponding survival function is
S(t) = 1 −

Z t

P(u)du = e−λt ,t > 0.

(4)

0

Hence, the average transition time is the conditional expectation of the distribution defined as follows:
t¯ = E[t|t > 1] =

Z ∞

t · P(t)dt =

Z ∞

1

t · λ e−λt dt =

+ 1.
λ

(5)

We fit the role transition time of the scientists with the aforementioned exponential distribution, thereby determining the
respective values of λ for AI-adopted junior scientists and their non-AI counterparts. Guided by the underlying mechanism
of junior scientists’ career development incorporated within the birth-death model, expectations from the model offer a more
accurate estimate of the average role transition time.
M8. Measure the knowledge extent of papers
To assess the knowledge extent of a set of research papers within their high-dimensional embeddings
{p[1], p[2], . . . , p[n]}, p[i] ∈ R768 ,

(6)

we first compute the centroid as the mean of their vector locations:
c=

1 n
∑ p[i].
n i=1

(7)

Next, we compute the Euclidean distance from each embedding to the centroid, where the knowledge extent of the set of papers
is defined as the maximum distance or “diameter” of the vector space covered:
KE = max ∥p[i] − c∥2 .
1≤i≤n

(8)

We note that Euclidean distance is highly correlated with the cosine and related angular distances.
In practice, the number of AI and non-AI papers in each domain differ substantially, introducing bias to the measurement of
knowledge extent. To address this issue, we build on prior work44 about cognitive extent2 . For each domain, we randomly
sample 1,000 papers from both AI and non-AI categories, compute their respective knowledge extent, and repeat this process
1,000 times. By comparing knowledge extent values across these 1,000 random samples, we ensure that the number of AI and
non-AI papers is balanced, making our knowledge extent results comparable.
M9. Measuring the knowledge extent of paper families
To measure how much knowledge space can be derived from each original research, we calculate the knowledge extent of
“paper families”, i.e., a focal paper and its follow-on citations. Focusing on an original research paper φ , which corresponds to
a high-dimensional embedding pφ ∈ R768 , we extract all nφ research papers that cite this original paper. These citing papers are
sorted chronologically by publication date, from earliest to most recent. The corresponding high-dimensional embeddings of
these sorted papers are:
{pφ [1], pφ [2], . . . , pφ [nφ ]}, pφ [i] ∈ R768 .

(9)

Thereby, we calculate knowledge extent covered by the “paper family” consists of the original paper φ and the first n follow-on
papers citing it (1 ≤ n ≤ nφ ) as:
KEφ [n] =

max ∥pφ [i] − pφ ∥2 .

1≤i≤n≤nφ

(10)

2 Cognitive extent is a measure of the breadth of a scientific field’s cognitive territory. It is quantified by the number of unique phrases, as a proxy for

scientific concepts, found within a sampled batch of papers with given size.

11/82

M10. Measure follow-on engagement among papers
To quantify how frequently citations of the same original paper interact with each other, we design a metric called follow-on
engagement building on prior work45 . For an original paper with n citations, there are at most n(n−1)
possible citations among
2
these n citing papers if everyone cites all papers published earlier than their own. We then count how many times these n citing
papers actually cite one another, denoted as k. Our metric for follow-on engagement is calculated as the ratio of actual to
maximum possible citations:
k
EG = n(n−1) =
2

2k
2k
=
× 100(%).
n(n − 1) n(n − 1)

(11)

This metric helps quantify the degree of interactions and collaboration among papers that cite the same original work. Prior
work has demonstrated a positive association between the ambiguity of a focal work and follow-on engagement45 .

expected time for junior scientists to become established is shorter for those who adopt AI (p < 0.001), while the expected time
for junior scientists to abandon academia is similar or slightly longer for those who adopt AI. Results indicate that AI not only
provides junior scientists opportunities to become established scientists at a younger age, but also reduces the risk of their
exiting academia early. For all panels, 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the mean. All statistical tests use a two-sided

and we provide 5 different random batches for each field to ensure robustness. As shown by the solid arrows and circular
boundaries, the knowledge extent of AI papers is smaller than that of a comparable sample of non-AI papers, which is

Supplementary Notes
1 Identifying artificial intelligence in scientific research
To thoroughly investigate how the adoption of AI impacts scientific research, the very rudimentary step is to identify the
AI papers from massive research papers published over the past decades. In this section, we discuss the details of AI paper
identification, covering the model and method design (Section 1.1), the accuracy evaluation (Section 1.2), the statistical
(Section 1.4) and semantic (Section 1.3) features of identified AI papers along the trend of scientific research over decades.
1.1 Identification model and method
As described in Methods M2 of the main text, we design a two-stage fine-tuning process to leverage the pre-trained BERT model
to identify papers that use AI to support natural science research. In the first stage, we construct coarse positive data with typical
AI journals and conferences to fine-tune the pre-trained model. In the second stage, we identify papers in the whole dataset with
the obtained optimal model in the first stage and aggregate the results for each venue. We then select the venues with > 80%
AI probability and > 100 papers as AI venues for positive data, and we also incorporate venues with “machine learning” or
“artificial intelligence” in their names. Finally, we utilize optimal ensemble models during both stages to identify all papers that
use AI to support natural science research from the selected representative natural science disciplines. To illustrate the final
identification results, we show the proportion and number of identified AI papers in each venue in Supplementary Fig. S1.
1.2 Identification accuracy evaluation
To evaluate the accuracy of our identification, we recruited a team of human experts with abundant AI research experience
(Supplementary Table S1) to validate the results. We sample 2 groups of papers at random from each of the 6 disciplines,
resulting in 12 paper groups in total, where samples in each group span all three eras of AI (Supplementary Table S2). We
assign three different experts to independently label each sampled paper and measure the consistency among experts based on
Fleiss’ Kappa coefficient37 . Results exhibit an overall Fleiss’ Kappa of 0.964, and each of the three eras of AI has a Fleiss’
Kappa greater than 0.93 (Supplementary Table S3), indicating strong consensus across the independent annotation of distinct
experts. Taking the expert labels as ground truth and validating the identification results of our BERT model against it, our
model reaches an overall F1-score of 0.875, and the F1-scores of the three eras of AI are all greater than 0.85 (Supplementary
Table S4). This indicates the consistent high quality of our AI paper identification, which lays a robust foundation for our
subsequent analysis.
To provide rationale and explainability for our identification results, we offer multiple identification examples from different
eras of AI and visualize the average attention strengths within our title and abstract BERT models. Our example for the ML
era is a medicine paper with AI published in PNAS 200667 , where our model allocates substantial attention to terms such as
“independent component analysis” (Supplementary Fig. S2a). In the DL era, our first example is a chemistry paper with AI
published in Nature 201868 , and our second is a biology paper with AI published in Nature 20219 , where our model allocates
substantial attention to terms such as “neural network” (Supplementary Fig. S2bc). Our example of the generative AI era is a
biology paper using AI and published in Science 202369 , where the model allocates substantial attention to terms such as “large
language model” (Supplementary Fig. S2d). These illustrate how our identification model correctly interprets and accurately
identifies various AI-related contents from papers published in different eras of AI.
Furthermore, to gain a deeper understanding of our identification results, we present an example in which the model makes
a mistake (Supplementary Fig. S3). The sample paper, published in Géoscience70 , is incorrectly classified by the model as
AI-related, but human experts confirm that the article does not involve AI methodologies. As we illustrate, the model assigns
substantial attention to terms like “representing” and “deep”, which are commonly associated with AI research. In the context
of this article, however, “representing” refers to general expression or depiction, which is unrelated to representation learning in
AI, and “deep” is used to describe the extent of uncertainty rather than indicating a deep neural network or similar AI concepts.
This example illustrates an edge case where the identification model may produce misclassifications. Nevertheless, given
the high F1-score observed in our evaluation of identification accuracy, such cases appear to be rare, and the effect on our
subsequent analyses minimal.
1.3 Profile of the identified AI papers
To better illustrate how AI has been applied in natural science research across different disciplines and AI development eras,
we present a semantic overview of the major research topics and the primary AI methods employed. For research topics,
AI-related studies tend to cluster around areas that integrate artificial intelligence with conventional disciplinary subjects
(Supplementary Fig. S4). For example, in the field of medicine, the topics “Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging” and
“Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition” rank among the most prominent. This reflects the widespread application of
computer vision techniques to enhance research in medical imaging.

For adopted AI methods, we extracted phrases from the abstracts of identified AI papers and calculated the frequency
of phrases related to specific AI techniques. We identified and listed the top 10 most frequently used AI methods for each
discipline and AI era (Supplementary Tables S5–S11). It is worth noting that in earlier years, due to the limited number of AI
papers, the number of commonly used AI methods may be fewer than ten. The results show that during the ML era, the most
frequently applied AI methods in natural science research included Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In the DL era, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a landmark
of the time, dominated the landscape, while traditional methods such as SVM continued to see widespread adoption. Since
the beginning of the generative AI era in 2023, Large Language Model (LLM) has increasingly appeared among the most
commonly used AI methods, with their frequency rankings steadily rising across disciplines. The evolution of AI methods in
natural science research reflects the development and transformation of AI technologies over the past decades.
1.4 Increasing prevalence of AI adoption in science
In the main text, the proportion of papers and researchers adopting AI exhibit exponential growth over the past decades. To
further illustrate and analyze this upward trend, we separately plot the proportion of papers and researchers adopting AI in each
discipline with a log-scale y-axis and estimate the growth rate with exponential fitting in each era (Supplementary Fig. S5-S6).
As results show, the proportion of papers and researchers adopting AI fit to straight regions in the log-scale plot, indicating an
exponential growth trend. Meanwhile, the growth rate of AI papers and AI researchers in all disciplines increased progressively
from the ML to the DL and generative AI eras, as estimated by the exponential fitting, which underscores the increasing
prevalence and fast development of AI in science.
Beyond the general upward trend of AI adoption in science, we further investigate how the recent emergence of generative AI
influences this trajectory. We calculate the monthly increase in the proportion of AI papers and researchers across disciplines in
recent years (Supplementary Fig. S7). Results show that following the release of ChatGPT in December 2022, which we regard
as the beginning of the generative AI era, growth rates in the proportion of papers and researchers initially remain consistent
with prior trends. A period of time later, however, these growth rates begin to exhibit marked acceleration across disciplines,
providing evidence for the impact of generative AI advancement. Meanwhile, it also aligns with intuitive expectation: the mass
adoption of generative AI in natural science research requires time, and there is an inherent delay for generative AI-based
research to pass through peer review and achieve publication.

2 Extended analyses on how AI impacts individual science
In the main text, we illustrate that AI research attracts more attention from academia, and AI-adopting scientists are more
likely to achieve higher scholarly productivity and impact. In this section, we discuss in more detail how AI impacts individual
science, covering the effect of AI on individual papers (Section 2.1) and individual scientists’ careers (Section 2.2).
2.1 The effect of AI on individual papers
As demonstrated in the main text, AI-related papers, on average, receive higher annual citation counts than non-AI papers.
Given that citation distributions are empirically right-skewed71,72 , we adopt multiple statistical indicators beyond the average
annual citation counts to ensure more robust conclusions (Supplementary Fig. S8-S9). For the right tail of the distribution,
namely papers with high citation counts, we observe that from year of publication and across subsequent decades, citations for
the top 1st and 5th-percentile of AI papers exceed those of non-AI papers by 152.39% and 48.27%, respectively. For the left
tail of the distribution, namely papers with low citation counts, we find that, over the same time period, the proportion of AI
papers receiving fewer than three and fewer than five citations each year is 2.49% and 2.46% lower, respectively, than non-AI
papers. Taken together, these findings suggest that AI papers not only tend to receive higher citations but are also less likely to
become low-impact publications, indicating the enhanced visibility and academic attention garnered by AI research.
In addition to the “velocity” of citation, shown above as the number of citations received per year after publication, we also
compare the “acceleration” of citations, namely the year-over-year change in annual citation counts, between AI and non-AI
papers (Supplementary Fig. S10). Results reveal that during the initial post-publication years when annual citations are generally
increasing, AI papers exhibit a faster acceleration in citation growth. In the subsequent period, after reaching peak citation
“velocity”, AI papers also exhibit a more rapid deceleration in annual citations. Over the longer term, the changing patterns
of annual citations to AI and non-AI papers converge, with no significant differences observed. Nevertheless, throughout the
entire citation lifecycle, the citation “velocity” of AI papers consistently remains higher than that of non-AI papers.
Empirically, review articles, editorial pieces, and other types of special publications tend to exhibit markedly different
citation patterns compared to original research papers. To verify the robustness of our finding that AI papers garner higher
academic impact, we distinguish these special publications from those reporting original research and replicate our analyses
exclusively on the latter (Supplementary Fig. S11-S12). Specifically, we filter publications labeled as “article” in the OpenAlex
dataset29 , thereby excluding journals dedicated to reviews as well as publication types such as letters, editorials, and erratum.
24/82

To further eliminate a small number of review articles that may still be included in non-review journals, we additionally filter
all papers with “review” or “survey” in their titles. As a result, these special pieces account for 9.26% of the 27,405,011
publications with intact reference records from our original analysis. After excluding them, we obtained a refined dataset of
24,867,012 original research papers. On this subset, AI papers still receive higher visibility and academic attention than their
non-AI counterparts across the previously introduced statistical indicators.
In our analysis of annual citations for AI and non-AI papers, we find that both types of papers continue to be cited even 20
or more years after publication. Given that fewer papers, especially AI-related ones, were published several decades ago and
that most scholarly works cite “historical” papers to situate their research within a broader context, it is important to understand
whether referenced papers are being cited as foundational citations or simply “throwaway” citations that the scholarly crowd
uses more colloquially. To address this, we follow an established methodology for distinguishing between core and superficial
citations73 , and we compute the times AI and non-AI papers are cited as core citations in each year following publication
(Supplementary Fig. S13). Results show that the proportion of AI papers to be cited as core citations tends to decrease over
time, which aligns with the intuitive expectation that older papers are more likely to be cited for historical context rather than as
active intellectual foundations. Nevertheless, foundational influence can still be observed in decades-old papers. For example,
two recent studies published in 2020 and 2021, which used AI techniques to predict diabetes74,75 , both cite a 1988 paper on the
ADAP learning algorithm76 as a foundational reference. Both newer papers build upon the prior algorithm to design more
advanced ensemble models. Moreover, in terms of absolute counts of being core citations, AI papers still surpass non-AI papers
by 98.70%, reflecting the heightened academic attention attracted by AI research.
AI represents a technology that started small and then became the most prominent method in multiple fields. As such,
AI papers exhibit a distinctive citation pattern compared to non-AI papers. To investigate whether this citation pattern is
unique to AI or also characteristic of other emerging technologies that started small and then became widely appreciated
and used, we conduct a comparative analysis using Nanotechnology as case study (Supplementary Fig. S14). We identified
Nanotechnology-related research by detecting the presence of the word “nano” in the titles of all publications. As shown,
Nanotechnology was sparsely studied in its early stages but began to gain widespread attention across disciplines such as
biology, chemistry, and physics beginning in the 1990s. We observe that Nanotechnology exhibits a citation pattern partially
similar to AI: Nanotechnology papers are still cited as core citations many years following publication, although the proportion
of being such core citations declines over time. In contrast to AI, however, both total number of citations and the frequency of
being core citations for Nanotechnology papers eventually decline to levels indistinguishable from non-Nanotechnology papers,
suggesting that nanotechnology does not exhibit the same sustained higher academic influence as AI.
To provide a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of AI papers, we analyze additional indicators beyond citationrelated statistics. First, we examine the distribution of AI papers across journals of varying Journal Citation Report (JCR)
quantiles40 (Supplementary Fig. S15). We find that the proportion of AI papers in Q1 journals is 18.60% higher than non-AI
ones in all journals, and in Q2 journals, the AI proportion is a scant 1.59% higher, while Q3 and Q4 journals hold a relatively
lower proportion of papers with AI. These results indicate a heterogeneous distribution of AI-augmented papers across journals,
with a higher prevalence in high-impact journals. Second, we examine the influence of AI and non-AI papers from the
perspective of disruption77,78 (Supplementary Fig. S16). Despite higher citation counts for AI papers, we find that their
disruption scores are lower. This suggests that while AI papers tend to influence a larger number of subsequent studies, the
higher impact is primarily developmental rather than disruptive, which means that they contribute to advancing (and completing)
existing fields rather than initiating new ones. This observation is consistent with our later finding that AI contracts science’s
focus.
2.2 The effect of AI on individual scientists’ careers
As shown in the main text, scientists who adopt AI tend to achieve higher scholarly productivity and impact. However, an
alternative explanation for this observation is whether these advantages are driven by AI adoption itself, or whether scientists
who are already on a trajectory toward greater productivity and impact are simply more likely to adopt AI. To investigate this,
we conducted a match-and-comparison analysis of scientists with similar early-career productivity and impact trajectories, but
who differ in their subsequent AI adoption behavior (Supplementary Fig. S17). Specifically, we filter 11,019 scientists who
began adopting AI in the third year of their careers and match them with 1,926 scientists who exhibited comparable annual
citation counts during their first three years but never adopted AI. The comparison reveals that starting from the third year, when
the former group began adopting AI, a divergence in annual citation counts emerges between the two groups. By the tenth year
of their careers, the scientists who adopted AI in their third year have 24.45% higher annual citations than their non-AI-adopting
counterparts with similar early trajectories. Similarly, their annual productivity in the tenth year is 9.61% higher than the
matched group of non-AI-adopters with comparable early-career productivity. The same pattern holds when analyzing a second
cohort: 9,837 scientists who adopted AI in the fifth year of their careers were compared with peers who had similar citation and
productivity levels in their first five years but never adopted AI. Taken together, these findings suggest that for scientists with
25/82

comparable early-career positions, adopting AI itself contributes to their subsequent advantages in productivity and impact.
In our main analysis, we include 2.3 million scientists with complete career trajectories and show that those adopting AI are
more productive and receive more citations. Prior research suggests that only a relatively small subset of scientists continue
publishing over long periods, however, forming what has been recognized as the global core of active researchers41 . To examine
whether our findings hold for this persistent group, we identified 1,495,265 researchers with uninterrupted publication records
over at least five consecutive years and 525,716 researchers over at least ten consecutive years, accounting for 52.30% and
18.39% of all researchers in our dataset, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S18). We then compared the productivity and citation
impact of AI-adopting versus non-AI-adopting researchers within these subsets. Among those with at least five consecutive
years of publications, researchers adopting AI published 2.40 times more papers and received 3.88 times more citations per year
than their non-AI counterparts, with consistent patterns observed across disciplines. Similarly, for researchers with at least ten
consecutive years of publications, who are more productive and receive more citations than researchers with five consecutive
years of publications, AI adopters published 2.41 times more papers and received 4.31 times more citations annually. These
results further confirm the positive impact of AI adoption on the career progression of both the continuously publishing core
scientists and broader population of normal scientists.
In our career transition model of researchers, we set a threshold of 3 years and regard scientists who have no more
publications after 2022 as having exited academia, where the threshold setting is consistent with previous research62 . To
ensure the robustness of our findings, we switch to different thresholds in detecting the dropout of researchers and replicate our
results (Supplementary Fig. S19). As we illustrate, when using different dropout thresholds of 2 or 4 years, the probability
for AI-adopted junior scientists to transition to established scientists is consistently higher than for their counterparts who do
not adopt AI, and the anticipated transition time to becoming established scientists is shorter for AI-adopted junior scientists
compared to their counterparts. These robust results underscore the role of AI in bringing about increased opportunities
for junior scientists to lead research teams and reducing the risks of their leaving academia. To assess the appropriateness
of our threshold for detecting researcher dropout, we analyzed the distribution of gap year durations in researcher careers
(Supplementary Fig. S20). Here, a period of gap years refers to a temporary interruption in a researcher’s publication activity,
followed by a subsequent resumption of publishing. Results show that 44.67% of all gap periods lasted only one year, and
76.94% lasted no more than three years. Therefore, when choosing a three-year threshold for identifying dropout events, it
can appropriately capture the majority of cases where researchers temporarily paused and then resumed publication activity.
Additionally, as we illustrate, both shorter and longer thresholds yield similar overall results. Nevertheless, a threshold that is
too short would misclassify many researchers with temporary gaps as dropouts, while a threshold too long would result in a
large number of researchers being classified as having uncertain status and excluded from analysis, thereby reducing the sample
size. Taking these considerations into account, we adopt a three-year threshold as a balanced and robust choice.
To better understand whether the adoption of AI affects all groups of scientists uniformly, we provide demographic
information on the people who are leaving the field (Supplementary Fig. S21). First, we utilized the “institution” field in the
OpenAlex dataset to determine researchers’ affiliations and categorized them into demographic groups based on institutional
attributes. On the one hand, we categorize institutions by type, such as companies, educational institutions, government agencies,
etc. Researchers affiliated with educational institutions exhibit the lowest dropout rates, although differences in dropout rates
across institution types are relatively modest. Notably, across all institutional types, researchers who adopt AI show similarly
reduced dropout probabilities. On the other hand, we categorize institutions by geographic region, including Africa, Europe,
Asia-Pacific, etc. We find that researchers based in Africa and South America have higher dropout probabilities compared with
those in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and North America. Furthermore, while AI adoption is associated with reduced dropout rates
for researchers in regions such as Asia-Pacific and North America, the benefit is far less pronounced for those in Africa and
South America. Second, we follow established methods in prior work and infer gender and ethnicity information based on
author names79 . The results show that White and API (Asian or Pacific Islander) researchers have lower dropout probabilities
compared to their Hispanic and Black counterparts. Meanwhile, AI adoption is associated with reduced dropout rates for White
and API researchers, while the benefit is much less pronounced for Black researchers. We also observe heterogeneity in the
effect between male and female researchers. Male researchers tend to have lower original dropout probabilities and receive
greater benefit from AI adoption. In contrast, female researchers exhibit higher original dropout probabilities and gain relatively
less from adopting AI. These findings provide preliminary evidence regarding the heterogeneous impact of AI on scientific
careers across different demographic groups, suggesting that the benefits of AI are unequally distributed, but the causes and
consequences of this heterogeneity merit further investigation.

3 Extended analyses on how AI impacts the overall science
In the main text, we illustrate the conflict between individual and collective incentives to adopt AI in science, where individual
scientists receive expanded personal reach and impact, but the knowledge extent of entire scientific fields shrinks to a narrower
focus. In this section, we discuss in more detail how AI impacts the entire knowledge extent. First, we illustrate the benefit of
26/82

topic diversity (Section 3.1). Second, we discuss multiple factors that may impact the selectivity of AI adoption in different
fields and thereby lead to the observed outcome of narrowed focus of AI-augmented research (Section 3.2).
3.1 The benefit of topic diversity
Given our observation of the contracted knowledge extent of AI-augmented research, a natural question arises: Is a broader
knowledge space, namely a greater diversity of research topics, indeed beneficial to the overall advancement of scientific
knowledge? To examine this, we categorize our selected papers into 252 distinct sub-fields and compute, for each sub-field,
the average citation count and disruption score77,78 across different eras of AI (Supplementary Fig. S22). Results show that,
across different sub-fields and eras of AI, neither citation (as a proxy for impact) nor disruption (as a proxy for novelty) is
obviously correlated with the sub-field’s knowledge extent. Specifically, the absolute values of Pearson’s r are below 0.1 in
almost all cases. This indicates that higher topic diversity within a subfield does not dissipate the sub-field’s intellectual energy
and reduce its scholarly impact or innovative capacity. Therefore, maintaining a broader diversity of research topics does not
hinder a sub-field’s performance; rather, it likely offers more opportunities for advancing the scientific frontier and provides
researchers with a wider array of investigation choices, ultimately benefiting the state of collective knowledge.
3.2 Selectivity of AI adoption across different topics
To gain a deeper understanding of our main findings that “AI in science has become more concentrated around some popular
research topics” and that “AI-augmented research focuses on a narrower scope”, we examine whether external factors might
influence the selectivity of AI adoption across different topics, potentially leading to their disproportionate representation.
Topicality. Certain topics may inherently lend themselves more to AI applications, potentially making them more likely
to be represented in AI-assist research. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the topical correlations between AI and
non-AI research (Supplementary Fig. S23). Based on citation relationships between AI and non-AI papers, we found that AI
research across various fields is more frequently cited by non-AI studies than by AI studies themselves. This suggests that
topics in AI research influence non-AI research rather than forming isolated, self-referential clusters of AI literature. There is
no obvious difference in topic selection between AI and non-AI research, indicating that inherent topicality does not account
for the disproportionate prevalence of AI-augmented research in different fields.
Original impact. Another possibility concerns whether the topics being squeezed out by AI are likely to be marginalized
anyway. That is, does AI tend to concentrate on more fruitful areas rather than topics with lower prior and potential impact?
To evaluate this, we categorize our selected papers into 1,883 topics according to the OpenAlex taxonomy. We calculate the
average citation count and disruption score77,78 of non-AI papers within each topic, obtaining proxies for the topic’s original
influence and novelty. We then examine, across topics, the correlation between the degree of AI penetration and the original
influence and novelty across different AI development eras, where the absolute values of Pearson’s r are below 0.1 in all cases
(Supplementary Fig. S24). The results show that across topics and AI eras, neither original citation nor original disruption
is obviously correlated with the proportion of AI adoption in that topic. This suggests that AI adoption does not selectively
favor topics based on their original impact. Instead, AI homogeneously penetrates into topics with both high and low original
influence.
Funding priority. Another potential factor that might influence the selectivity of AI adoption across different topics is
funding priority, which means that funding agencies may tend to directly support AI research more in some specific research
topics. To evaluate this, we merge information from the “grants” field in the OpenAlex dataset and acknowledgment texts
in the Web of Science (WOS) dataset30,31 , obtaining 31,115,808 coded funding data acknowledgments from 32,437 funding
agencies. By categorizing our selected papers into topics as mentioned above, we calculate the deviation of the probability that
AI papers are funded in each topic from the average level and obtain the indicator of funding priority to the topics. We then
examined, across topics, correlation between the degree of AI penetration and funding priority across different AI development
eras, where the absolute values of Pearson’s r are below 0.1 in all cases (Supplementary Fig. S25). Results show that across
topics and AI eras, there are heterogeneous funding priorities, but funding priority is not obviously correlated with proportion
of AI adoption, suggesting that policy-makers’ choices do not obviously affect AI adoption on selective topics.
Data abundance. As discussed in the main text, the knowledge extent of entire scientific fields tends to shrink to focus
attention on areas most amenable to AI research, such as those with an abundance of data. To directly evaluate the impact of
data abundance on the selectivity of AI adoption across topics, we extract and quantify the appearance frequency of data-related
terms, such as “data” and “dataset”, in titles and abstracts of papers within each topic. We then normalize these frequencies to
serve as an indicator of data abundance for each topic. We then examine, across topics, correlation between the degree of AI
penetration and data abundance across different AI development eras (Supplementary Fig. S26). Results show that, as expected,
data abundance is diverse across topics, while across AI eras, data abundance is positively and significantly (p < 0.001 for all
eras) correlated with the proportion of AI adoption, suggesting that AI is more likely to be adopted in topics with abundant data
resources. Notably, the correlation of AI-use with frequency of mentioned data resources rises with the size and intensity of
AI-models from 0.24 in the machine learning era to 0.36 in the deep learning era to 0.43 in the large model era.
27/82

In general, data abundance is a major external factor influencing the selectivity of AI adoption across different topics,
contributing to the observed disproportionate representation within knowledge space and the contraction of scientific focus,
whereas the other external variables discussed above appear to be largely unrelated. This finding elucidates factors underlying
the heterogeneous adoption of AI across topics and provides valuable insights into how AI can be better leveraged to promote
sustainable and comprehensive scientific development.
Given the selectivity of AI across topics, we further examined the consistency of our findings regarding the contracted
knowledge extent of AI-augmented research in different topics. We conducted stratified analyses to control for the effects
of the external factors discussed above, which may impact the finding as confounding variables (Supplementary Fig. S27).
Results show that when we control each external factor by partitioning them into 10 tiers based on magnitude, contraction in
knowledge extent for AI-augmented research remains evident within each tier. Regardless of whether a topic is more or less
likely to be selected for AI adoption, our findings hold consistently: existing AI-augmented research within the topic tends to
cover a contracted knowledge space compared to non-AI research.

4 Robustness analyses
4.1 Robustness of results in the generative AI era
Because generative AI has not been around for very long and there remains a lead time before publications using them appear,
the available data regarding generative AI is necessarily limited for analysis. To verify the robustness of our general findings
over decades of AI development to the specific era of generative AI, we replicated our findings with only the subset of papers
published during the generative AI era. Of the 41,298,433 publications in our OpenAlex and Web of Science analyses that
cover six disciplines, 4,797,614 are published in the generative AI era. As we show in Supplementary Fig. S28-S30, all results
in the generative AI era are consistent with those from prior decades of AI development.
This separate analysis of AI from the generative AI era could exhibit limitations due to the lack of data caused by the
relatively short history of generative AI, including LLMs. One major point is that our method of detecting scientists’ career
role transitions requires scientists to maintain a certain length of publication history, which is not feasible separately in the short
generative AI era. Therefore, we are not able to replicate the analysis regarding the career development of individual scientists.
Although reaching quantitatively consistent conclusions, with the limited data currently available, results in the generative
AI era may appear less significant than corresponding results in our general findings and serve as a starting point for future
research as these new models develop and are deployed in new ways. As large, generative models evolve over longer periods of
time and produce richer data, additional evaluations should be pursued, further revealing how generative AI impacts scientific
development consistent with traditional machine learning techniques or representing new directions.
4.2 Robustness of results on the Web of Science dataset
To verify the robustness of our findings on a more restricted dataset of high-quality papers, we replicated our analysis using the
subset of articles from the OpenAlex that also appear in the Web of Science (WOS) dataset30,31 . To extract the publications in
WOS, we subsetted the OpenAlex publications that could be linked to the WOS dataset based on a shared DOI or a PubMed
Identifier (PMID). Of the 41,298,433 publications in our OpenAlex analyses that cover six disciplines, 23,576,370 could be
linked to a WOS publication. As we show in Supplementary Fig. S31-S33, all of the results on the WOS dataset are consistent
with those from the OpenAlex dataset in the main text.
4.3 Robustness of distance calculations in the high-dimensional paper embedding space
Because multiple important analyses in the main text are presented based on the distance calculated in the paper embedding
space, it is crucial to ensure reliability of our distance calculations for high-dimensional vectors. To evaluate this, we utilize a
principal components analysis (PCA) approach. We first identified the number of principal components required to explain
90% of the total variance in the original 768-dimensional embeddings, which we determined to be 135. We then projected the
original embeddings onto these principal components and recalculated distances in this reduced-dimensional space to replicate
our analysis. As we show in Supplementary Fig. S34-S35, all results in the reduced-dimensional space are consistent with
those from the original embedding space reported in the main text.
In addition to replicating our analysis in the reduced-dimensional space, we further tested the sensitivity of our distance
calculations. Using the same PCA method, we reduce the original embeddings to 86, 135, and 197 dimensions, which
correspond to the principal components that explain 80%, 90%, and 95% of the total variance, respectively. We then randomly
sample 1,000 NonAI-NonAI, 1,000 AI-AI, and 1,000 NonAI-AI paper pairs and calculate the distance for each pair within
each of the reduced-dimensional spaces. As we show in Supplementary Fig. S36, distances in the various reduced-dimensional
spaces are highly correlated with those in the original space, with Pearson’s r greater than 0.95 (p < 0.001 for all groups).
Besides the sensitivity to embedding dimension, we also check the robustness regarding different distance measurements.
We substitute all Euclidean distance into Cosine distance and replicate our analyses. As we show in Supplementary Fig. S37,
28/82

all results with Cosine distance are consistent with the original ones with Euclidean distance in the main text. These results
demonstrate the robustness of our distance calculations based on paper embeddings, ensuring the reliability of our distance-based
analyses and suggesting the potential for future research to leverage these distance metrics for further analyses.

citation for AI and non-AI papers from year of publication (n = 24, 867, 012). (b) Top 5th-percentile annual citation for AI and
non-AI papers from year of publication (n = 24, 867, 012). (c) Proportion of AI and non-AI papers receiving fewer than three
citations each year from year of publication (n = 24, 867, 012). (d) Proportion of AI and non-AI papers receiving fewer than
five citations each year from year of publication (n = 24, 867, 012). Results are consistent with the overall statistics in the main
text. For all panels, 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the mean.

Figure 13. Distinguishing between core and superficial citations. Results show that the proportion of AI papers cited as
core citations tends to decrease over time (green line), while foundational influence can still be observed in decades-old papers
(n = 27, 405, 011). In terms of the absolute count of instances being among the core citations in future papers, AI papers still
outperform non-AI papers (red and blue bars), reflecting their enhanced academic impact. 99% CIs are shown as error bars
centred at the mean.

non-Nanotechnology papers (n = 17, 976, 303). (c) Annual times of being core citation following publication of
Nanotechnology and non-Nanotechnology papers (n = 17, 976, 303). Nanotechnology papers are still cited as core citations
many years after publication, with the proportion of being among the core citations declining over time. In contrast to AI, both
total number of citations and the frequency of being core citations for Nanotechnology papers eventually decline to levels
indistinguishable from non-Nanotechnology papers. For panels (b) and (c), 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the
mean.

Comparison of the relative share of AI and non-AI papers published in different journals (n = 11, 098), where 99% CIs are
shown as error bars centred at the mean. (b) The change in the percentage of AI papers in journals with different JCR quantiles.
The percentages of AI papers rise in all journals, and the percentages of AI papers in Q1 (blue) and Q2 (orange) journals are
higher than the total percentage in all journals (black). These results indicate that AI-augmented papers are more likely to be
published in high-impact journals (Q1 and Q2) than papers without AI. These statistics are obtained based on papers published
before 2021, comparable with the 2021 JCR quantile data we used.

Comparison of annual publications between researchers adopting AI and their counterparts without AI among those with at

Figure 22. Correlation analysis between knowledge extent and citation or disruption of sub-fields. For all panels, each
scatter represents a sub-field, and the corresponding Pearson’s r is indicated correspondingly. Results show that, across
sub-fields and eras of AI development, neither citation impact (as a proxy for impact) nor disruption (as a proxy for novelty) is
obviously correlated with the sub-field’s knowledge extent.

Figure 23. Selectivity of AI adoption in different topics regarding topicality itself. The citation relationships between AI
and non-AI papers show that AI research across various fields is more frequently cited by non-AI studies than by AI studies
themselves (p < 0.001, n = 27, 405, 011). This suggests that topics in AI research influence non-AI research rather than
forming isolated, self-referential clusters of AI literature. There tends to be no obvious difference in topic selection between AI
and non-AI research, indicating that inherent topicality does not account for the observed more narrow focus of AI-augmented
research. 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the mean, and the statistical tests use a two-sided t-test.

scatter shows the degree of AI penetration in a topic and the original citation count or disruption score within that topic. The
corresponding Pearson’s r is indicated in each panel. Results show that across topics and AI eras, neither the original citation
nor the original disruption is obviously correlated with the proportion of AI adoption, suggesting that AI adoption does not
selectively favor topics based on differential original impact.

for different topics, but funding priority is not obviously correlated with the proportion of AI adoption, suggesting that AI
adoption does not selectively favor topics prioritized by funding agencies.

Figure 26. Selectivity of AI adoption in different topics regarding data abundance in the topics. In all panels, each scatter
shows the degree of AI penetration in a topic and the data abundance in that topic. The corresponding Pearson’s r is indicated
correspondingly in each panel. The results show that across topics and AI eras, the data abundance is positively correlated with
the proportion of AI adoption, suggesting that AI is more likely to be adopted in topics with abundant data resources. Notably,
the correlation of AI-use with frequency of mentioned data resources rises with the size and intensity of AI-models.

Figure 27. Stratified analyses controlling for the effects of potential confounding variables on the contracted knowledge
extent of AI-augmented research. The results show that when dividing each external factor into 10 tiers based on magnitude,
the contraction in knowledge extent for AI-augmented research remains evident within each tier (p < 0.001, n = 17, 529, 094).
Therefore, regardless of whether a topic is more or less likely to be selected for AI adoption, existing AI-augmented research
within the topic consistently covers a contracted knowledge space compared to non-AI research. For all panels, 99% CIs are
shown as error bars centred at the mean. All statistical tests use a two-sided t-test.

Figure 36. General sensitivity check on the distance calculations in high-dimensional paper embedding space. We

explain (a) 80%, (b) 90%, and (c) 95% of the total variance, respectively. We then randomly sampled 1,000 NonAI-NonAI,
1,000 AI-AI, and 1,000 NonAI-AI paper pairs and calculated the distance for each pair within each of the reduced-dimensional
spaces. Results show that the distances in the various reduced-dimensional spaces are highly correlated with those in the
original space, indicating the reliability of our paper embeddings for distance calculations.
