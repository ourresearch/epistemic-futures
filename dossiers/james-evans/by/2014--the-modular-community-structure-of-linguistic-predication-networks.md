Abstract

Word-word predications, observed as the copular is-a form in English, are important because,
unlike most grammatical constructions that have
few semantic constraints, predications tend to imply category membership or equivalence. Take (i)
and (ii) for example:

This paper examines the structure of linguistic predications in English text. Identified by the copular “is-a” form, predications assert category membership (hypernymy) or equivalence (synonymy) between two words. Because predication
expresses ontological structure, we hypothesize that networks of predications
will form modular groups. To measure
this, we introduce a semantically motivated measure of predication strength
to weight relevant predications observed
in text. Results show that predications
do indeed form modular structures without any weighting (Q ≈ 0.6) and that
using predication strength increases this
modularity (Q ≈ 0.9) without discarding low-frequency items.
This high
level of modularity supports the networkbased analysis and the use of predication
strength as a way to extract dense semantic
clusters. Additionally, words’ centrality
within communities exhibits slight correlation with hypernym depths in WordNet,
underscoring the ontological organization
of predication.

(i) Safety is always a primary concern.

(i) is a category assertion (safety as a type of concern) and (ii) is an equivalence assertion (organization is an institution). Most predications can be
interpreted as category memberships like (i); explicit articulation of equivalence is actually quite
rare in language (Cimiano, 2006; Cimiano and
Völker, 2005). Although some categorical predications are metaphorical, many of these are interpreted using category matching or analogical mapping processes (Glucksberg et al., 1997; Bowdle
and Gentner, 2005). In both semantic interpretations, predications naturally form a directed network of words. Consisting primarily of category
assertions, the structure of this network should exhibit a degree of natural clustering owing natural
categories of the those things it represents.
Network representations of language have been
used to describe a wide range of structures in language, including word-word and word-document
co-occurrences, term collocations, dependency
structure and named entity relations. Networks of
grammatical relations have been found to differentiate word-classes (Ferrer i Cancho et al., 2004)
and semantic networks can be used to model vocabulary growth (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005).
Co-occurrence networks, which are perhaps the
most widely studied natural language network, are
the foundation of many vector-space models (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Turney et al., 2010)
and can be used to mine synonyms (Cohen et
al., 2005), disambiguate word senses (Agirre et

Introduction & Background

Statistical patterns in language use are evident at
many levels and have proved useful in an increasingly wide range of computational and cognitive
applications. Statistical regularities offer a way
to quantify and model how people create, encode
and use knowledge about the world. Statements
specifically about “what things are” (ie. ontological statements) offer uniquely transparent evidence about peoples’ knowledge of the world. Our
research adopts a corpus-based approach in which
networks of predications are analyzed to assess the
underlying structure of ontological assertions.

network provides a natural way to weight edges,
but predications have no analogue to a proximitybased weighting scheme. One option would be to
weight edges by the number of times given predications were observed. While this is perhaps the
most obvious way to account for important predications, it risks exaggerating high-frequency items
that are common for reasons other than importance
(perhaps they are idioms, collocates or found in
abnormally strong colligational structures). Frequency weighting would also be susceptible to
noise from the many low-frequency items. To address these concerns, we introduce a semantically
informed measure of predication relevance.
Wilks’ (1975; 1978) theory of preference semantics proposes that subject- and object-verb relationships evince “selectional preference”, which
can be thought of as the disposition verbs have
to select certain arguments – particular classes of
subjects or objects. To operationalize selectional
preference, Resnik (1997) introduced selectional
preference strength to measure the disposition or
“preference” of a verb, v:

al., 2014; Biemann, 2006) and even help mark
the quality of essays (Foltz et al., 1999). Spectral methods applied to linguistic networks have
been used to differentiate languages (Ferrer i Cancho et al., 2004), word-classes (Sun and Korhonen, 2009) and genres of text (Ferrer i Cancho et
al., 2007). Using spectral methods, research has
also found that syntactic and semantic distributional similarity networks have considerably different structure (Biemann et al., 2009). The use
of lexical graphs (networks of words) in particular, pre-dates modern NLP (Rapoport et al., 1966),
though the approach continues to influence a variety of NLP and information retrieval tasks like
summarization and retrieval (Erkan and Radev,
2004; Véronis, 2004). Network-based methods
have even used community detection, similar to
the algorithm described in this paper, to extract
specialist terms from sets of multi-theme documents (Grineva et al., 2009) as well as unstructured texts (Gerow, 2014).
Because predications naturally form directed
chains of ontological assertions, we hypothesize
that their underlying structure is systematic and
modular, given its representation of naturally organized things in the world. Our method employs
community detection on networks of noun-noun
predications as a way to assess the overall structure of predication, but it could be extended to
hypernym and category extraction tasks (Hearst,
1992; Caraballo, 1999). Specifically, we test for
community structure in predications and explore
whether this structure becomes more highly resolved when using a semantic measure of predication strength introduced in the following section.
We also predict that central nodes (i.e. words)
in individual modules will correlate to categorical super-ordinance or hypernymy. Thus, we first
seek to assess the overall community structure
of predication, testing whether or not it is more
resolved using a novel measure of predication
strength. Second, within communities of predications, we compare the words’ closeness centrality to their positions in WordNet’s hypernym tree
(Miller, 1995).

where C is a set of semantic classes from which
v can select and R is the grammatical relation in
question. Note that SR (v) is effectively the sum
K-L divergence between the probabilities of v and
c for all classes. In a corpus-based setting, the
probability of any word can be estimated by its
relative frequency: P (x) = Pf (x)

on to define a measure of selectional association

In the typical form of selectional preference induction – the task of estimating likelihoods over all
classes – Eq. 2 is used to measure a verb’s preference for classes of nominal subjects or objects
like vehicles, insects, birds, etc. (Resnik, 1997;
Shutova et al., 2013).
To test our assumptions regarding the modular structure of predications in English, a measure like selectional association should account
for predicates’ diversity (or uniformity) of attachment. That is, the preference a predicate has to

Unlike co-occurrence networks, where words are
related simply by proximity, predication networks
are built using extracted grammatical relationships. The implied relationship in a co-occurrence

operate on a wide or narrow range of words. To account for this, we add a term, U (p), to account for
the relative number of unique words a predicate p
has been observed to predicate. Note that this is
not the total number of predications involving p,
which would produce problematically high values
were p to collocate strongly with the words it predicates. Instead, U (p) addresses and normalizes for
the diversity with which p is applied. Additionally,
instead of using a pre-set collection of semantic
classes on which predication is assumed to operate, each predicate is treated as its own class. For
a predication consisting of word w predicated by
p, predication strength is defined as follows:

P S(w, p) =

1
P (w|p)
log
SR (p)
U (p)P (w)

(3)

P S thus combines three important properties of
predications: the relative frequency of a given
predication P (w|p), the relative frequency of a
word P (w) and the diversity of a word’s potential predications U (p). Defined like this, U (p)
helps diminish the contribution of predicates that
are widely applicable, under the assumption that
being widely used, they are in-fact somewhat less
significant. Using this measure to weight edges
in a predication network should help diminish
the contribution of exceptionally frequent predications as well as that from low-frequency predications without excluding them.
An example predication network is shown in
Figure 1. In these networks, a network is constructed over a set of documents where nodes are
the words in a predication, the direction following the is-a link. Thus, example (i) would result in a link from safety to concern with weight
1. Were another predication involving concern to
be observed, another edge would be added from
that node. Note that circularities are allowed even
though this example is acyclic. To assess predication strength as a relevance function, we compare the community structure of weighted and
unweighted networks. The example in Figure 1
shows a sample network (top) and the communities extracted from the unweighted and weighted
versions of the same network (middle and bottom).
Note the changes in community assignments from
the unweighted version to the weighted. In particular, observe the new clusters in the weighted
network around money, factor and murder. If our

intuitions about the systematic nature of linguistic predication is correct, there should be at least
a moderate degree of community structure in the
unweighted networks, and if predication displays
semantic preference similar to selectional association, this community structure should be stronger
for networks weighted by predication strength.

Two methods were used to extract communities
from the predication networks: the Infomap and
walktrap algorithms. By using two methods, we
attain some assurance that our findings are not artifacts of the assumptions underlying either algorithm. The Infomap algorithm is an informationtheoretic method that exploits the analogue between optimizing a compression dictionary and
simplifying a graph by describing “flow” through
nodes (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008). Infomap assumes edges in a network induce such flow and
by deriving a minimum description of this flow,
the algorithm can find multi-level communities
in large networks (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2011).
The second method, walktrap, operationalizes the
intuition that a large set of short random walks on
a network will leave walkers on some groups of
nodes more often than others (Pons and Latapy,
2005). By setting the walk distance to a small
value, relative to a network’s density, walkers will
tend toward communities if the walker sample is
sufficient. These algorithms are both known to
work well with large, directed networks and neither imposed intractable computational burdens at
our scale (Fortunato, 2010; Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2009). Because both algorithms require a
connected network, our analysis is restricted to the
largest connected component (LCC) for all networks, though we have no reason to believe results
would differ significantly for other components.
Community assignments can be assessed by
measuring how self-contained or “modular” the
resulting communities are. Modularity was introduced as a way to choose the level of an optimal
cut for hierarchical partitioning algorithms, analogous to the level in the dendrogram that yields the
best communities (Newman and Girvan, 2004).
For a network with adjacency matrix A and community assignments c, modularity is defined as:

The school librarian may be the person that controls [...]
You may find Rachel is the one person who may [...]
Neither the state nor its government is a person.
An arbitrator is a person who is appointed [...]
On the other hand, an expert is a person to fix [...]
After all, the vendor is the person best able to [...]
An expert need not be an individual person.
The innocent party is a natural person.
If the indemnifier is a natural person, [...]
consumers who are natural persons under the Directive.

the word person as the target in the BNC. In each
case an edge would connect the predicate (in italics) to person (in bold).

Results

To explore the structure of predication networks,
we analyzed two corpora using the method described above: the British National Corpus (BNC)
(Leech et al., 2001) and the enTenTen web corpus.
Predications were extracted templates over a POStagged version of each corpus using the Sketch Engine1 tool (Kilgarriff et al., 2004). The BNC contained about 112 million tokens and the enTenTen
collection has 3.2 billion tokens. For each collection, the top 1,000 most frequent nouns provided
a seed set from which to extract all predicate
and predicate of relations2 (see examples in
Table 1). For the BNC, this resulted in 40,721
predications (14,319 unique) and 260,555 (20,651
unique) for the enTenTen collection. Predication
strength scores were computed for every predication using within-corpus relative frequencies.
These scores were used to weight edges in one
version of the predication network, whereas the
edge-weights of the “unweighted” version were
uniformly set to 1.0. No node-weighting was applied in either case.

have relatively strong community structure (New51

man, 2010). Here, we use modularity instead of
a measure of semantic similarity or semantic coherence because predication is seldom an assertion of equivalence or similarity. This means that
although words in predication communities may
be related in an ontological sense, such an assessment would not expose the level of independence
between the communities.
Weighted and unweighted networks from both
corpora were submitted to each community detection algorithm, the results of which were assessed
using modularity. We also carried out this analysis on frequency-weighted networks, the results
of which were similar to the unweighted configuration, but are not reported for sake of brevity.
Figure 2 shows the modularity for each configuration with varying minimum predication frequency (the number of times a predication had
to occur to be included). Varying the minimum
frequency thresholds helps simulate the effect of
corpus-size on the algorithm. In the BNC, unweighted networks with no minimum edge frequency show slight modularity (Q = 0.30),
whereas in weighted networks it is quite strong
(Q = 0.89). The enTenTen corpus exhibits a
gap between the unweighted (Q = 0.61) and
weighted networks (Q = 0.88) at low edge thresholds. This shows that predication strength is helpful in weighting relevant items without excluding low-frequency observations. The lower modularity scores (Q; Eq. 4) in the unweighted networks may be due to more novel, loose or figurative associations found in low-frequency predications that inappropriately connect unrelated communities. Interestingly, scores for unweighted and
weighted networks converge up to a point as the
minimum frequency increases (reducing the size
of the network). This pruning is helpful for the
unweighted networks, but has little effect on the
weighted versions. In all cases, sparsity takes a
toll as the LCC becomes quite small. The reason
for the eventual decline as the LCC shrinks below
70 nodes is because communities are less likely to
form at all in small networks.

the BNC (top) and enTenTen (bottom). Note, as
the minimum frequency increases (bottom axis)
and the LCC contains fewer and fewer nodes (top

not produce a solution with more than one community, resulting in undefined modularity.
a community to be members of higher-level categories. In figure 1, for example, summer, hour and
holiday all point to time, one could infer that time
is a shared hypernym. We use closeness centrality,
a graph-theoretic measure of node’s average proximity to other nodes, as a within-community measure of super-ordinance (i.e. hypernymy). Though
there a number of network centrality measures,
closeness centrality is a robust measure, though it
tends not to scale well to larger networks because
it requires computing the distance between every
pair of nodes (Friedl et al., 2010).

In addition to the highly modular structure, the
communities of predications themselves are likely
to represent some semantic organization. Specifically, we looked for a categorical structure within
the communities by comparing words to the hypernym tree in WordNet (Miller, 1995). Intuitively, one would expect words that are central in
52

most likely to occur. The predication networks
analyzed rely on a relatively tight definition of
predication, one that, in other languages, may not
be accessible by the copular form. Additionally,
the two literal interpretations of linguistic predications, equivalence or category membership, may
also not be common in all languages. To the extent
that parsers or taggers are available, a comparative
analysis would broaden the understanding of
predication in general.

The centrality scores in the communities were
compared to WordNet using the first sense-entry
for each node (which is typically the most common) and words not found in the tree were discarded. For the unweighted networks across both
corpora, we found a mean Spearman correlation of
r=0.35 (p < 0.01; using Fisher’s transformation)
for the Infomap algorithm and r=0.38 (p < 0.01)
for walktrap. In the weighted versions, Infomap
produced r=0.41 (p < 0.01) and walktrap produced r=0.44 (p < 0.01). This confirms that
predication communities tend to specify categorical knowledge is moderately similar to WordNet.
Note these correlation values are comparable between the weighted and unweighted networks, implying that relevance, as selectional association, is
not an important marker of the communities’ hypernymic composition.

Given their high modularity, predication structures could be exploited further for a number of
NLP tasks. The correlations between centrality
and hypernym depth mean that predication networks could help construct or update categorical
taxonomies. For example, these networks could
help automate the construction of a hypernym taxonomy with weighted branches, potentially augmenting resources like WordNet (Ruiz-Casado et
al., 2005; Miller, 1995). One could also examine the growth, combination and bifurcation
of specific communities to help track ontological
commitments, either over time as shifts in language structures (Gerow and Ahmad, 2012), or
across genre and domain (Davies, 2010). Further, because predication encodes categorical information, its community structure may also encode higher-level relations where strong intercommunity links imply relationships between
classes of objects.

Discussion

The analysis in this paper is an attempt to identify whether or not ontological knowledge expressed in text consists of meaningful clusters.
With the network representation and our measure
of predication strength, results indicate that predication forms strong community structures. Overall, results point to the highly modular nature of
predication, previously unreported in language.
This confirms our prediction that predication comprises systematic clusters of related things and the
higher modularity observed in networks weighted
by predication strength implies that predication
exhibits a form of selectional preference. Predication’s strong community structure is important
because it supports the use of linguistic patterns
in establishing ontological representations, which
naturally form higher-level groups.
Technically, our measure of predication
strength, which is built on prior assessments of
selectional preference, identifies the modular
semantic structure of predication even when
low frequency predications are included. This
may be because low-frequency predications are
more likely to inscribe novel, loose or figurative
associations that reach between semantic clusters
to inappropriately decrease the overall modularity
if not down-weighted. As a result, more systematic comparison of weighted and unweighted
networks, and the relative location of predication within these structures, will reveal where
semantic innovation and figurative assertions are

Our study examined the topographical structure of English predications in general, structure that consists, in large part, of hypernym relations. Though the relations in the examined
networks are defined by copular is-a predication structure, within-community hierarchies correlated only moderately with the hypernym hierarchy in WordNet. This implies that the predications
comprising our networks are either not entirely
hypernymic or that WordNet is not a good baseline. Indeed, predication is a grammatical relationship that often asserts synonymy or figurative
hypernymy (perhaps sometimes also metonymy)
and it is not apparent from the surface structure
how these semantic interpretation could be disambiguated. One reason this correlation is not higher
is likely to do with the low coverage of the copular
form as evidence of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992).
Further work regarding the structure of predications could build on the network framework to
evaluate the communities themselves. What prop53

erties differentiate communities? Are there semantic, lexical or statistical properties that contribute to the formation of communities? Are there
discernible differences between words that typify
communities as opposed to those that bridge communities? Predication communities are primarily semantic in nature, implying that central nodes
would typify meaningful aspects of their community. It would also be relatively easy to extend
network representations to address more qualitative aspects such as coherence, word norms and
word associations. Indeed, a variety of corpusbased research could employ network-based methods like those exemplified in this paper, capitalizing on graph-theory, social network analysis and
statistical physics, without departing from relational structures inherent to language.
