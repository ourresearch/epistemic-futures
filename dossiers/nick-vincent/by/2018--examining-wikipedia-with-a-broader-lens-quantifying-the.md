ABSTRACT

The extensive Wikipedia literature has largely considered
Wikipedia in isolation, outside of the context of its broader
Internet ecosystem. Very recent research has demonstrated
the significance of this limitation, identifying critical
relationships between Google and Wikipedia that are highly
relevant to many areas of Wikipedia-based research and
practice. This paper extends this recent research beyond
search engines to examine Wikipedia’s relationships with
large-scale online communities, Stack Overflow and Reddit
in particular. We find evidence of consequential, albeit
unidirectional relationships. Wikipedia provides substantial
value to both communities, with Wikipedia content
increasing visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find
little evidence that these websites contribute to Wikipedia in
return. Overall, these findings highlight important
connections between Wikipedia and its broader ecosystem
that should be considered by researchers studying Wikipedia.
Critically, our results also emphasize the key role that
volunteer-created Wikipedia content plays in improving
other websites, even contributing to revenue generation.

recruitment and retention strategies (e.g. [17,18,59,62]), and
even to train many state-of-the-art artificial intelligence
algorithms [12,13,25,26,36,58]. Indeed, Wikipedia has
likely become one of the most important datasets and
research environments in modern computing [25,28,36,38].
However, a major limitation of the vast majority of the
Wikipedia literature is that it considers Wikipedia in
isolation, outside the context of its broader online ecosystem.
The importance of this limitation was made quite salient in
recent research that suggested that Wikipedia’s relationships
with other websites are tremendously significant
[15,35,40,57]. For instance, this work has shown that
Wikipedia’s relationships with other websites are important
factors in the peer production process and, consequently,
have impacts on key variables of interest such as content
quality, reader demand, and contribution patterns [35,57].
Perhaps more importantly, however, this recent research has
additionally suggested that the reverse is also true: Wikipedia
content appears to play a substantially more important role
in the Internet ecosystem than anticipated, with other
websites having critical dependencies on Wikipedia content.
In particular, McMahon et al. [35] showed that the clickthrough rates of Google SERPs (search engine results pages)
drop dramatically when Wikipedia links are removed,
suggesting that Google is quite reliant on Wikipedia to
satisfy user information needs. Among other implications,
this means that the Wikipedia peer production processes
studied in the social computing literature likely have a
substantial – and largely unstudied – impact on other
websites. McMahon et al.’s results also raised important
questions related to the revenue being generated by for-profit
institutions using volunteer-created Wikipedia content,
especially in light of Wikipedia’s limited donation income.
Recognizing the importance of understanding Wikipedia’s
relationships with its broader online ecosystem, the
Wikimedia Foundation (the operator of Wikipedia) has
called for more research on these relationships as a central
part of its “New Research Agenda” for Wikipedia [51]. The
goal of the research presented in this paper is to help address
this call. More specifically, we seek to extend McMahon et
al.’s work on Wikipedia’s relationship with Google into a


different and important area of the online ecosystem: other
large-scale online communities.
In line with guidance in the social computing community to
increase robustness through the use of multi-community
analyses [48,53], we examine Wikipedia’s relationship with
two distinct large-scale online communities: Stack Overflow
(SO) and Reddit. Users post links to Wikipedia on both SO
and Reddit, facilitating an important, and potentially
bidirectional, relationship with Wikipedia.
Following the high-level structure of McMahon et al [35],
this paper asks two overarching research questions about
Wikipedia’s relationship with SO and Reddit:
RQ1: What value is Wikipedia providing to other large-scale
online communities like Stack Overflow and Reddit? (i.e.
Does Wikipedia content increase community engagement
and/or company revenue?)
RQ2: What value do these large-scale online communities
provide to Wikipedia? (i.e. Are they contributing page
views? Editors?)
We additionally take an important step beyond McMahon et
al. and investigate how the quality of Wikipedia articles
affects the relationships examined in RQ1 and RQ2. In other
words, we look at the association between the quality of
articles on Wikipedia and the value that Wikipedia provides
to external entities, and vice versa.
We address our RQs using a combined framework of
associative and causal analyses that allows us to estimate
Wikipedia’s relationships with SO and Reddit under a range
of conditions. For instance, at the upper bound of this range,
our associative analyses allow us to ask, “How much value
would be lost from SO and Reddit if posts containing
Wikipedia links never appeared?” Similarly, to estimate a
lower bound on the value Wikipedia could be providing to
SO and Reddit, we use causal analysis to examine the
counterfactual scenario, “What if the posts containing
Wikipedia links remained unchanged content-wise, but
instead had a link to a site other than Wikipedia?”
The results of our analyses indicate that Wikipedia creates a
large amount of value for SO and Reddit, even in our lowerbound estimates. More specifically, we observe that posts
containing Wikipedia links on both sites are exceptionally
valuable posts, with engagement metrics like user-voted
scores much higher than posts that do not contain Wikipedia
links (often by a factor of at least 2x, and sometimes as much
as 4x-5x). This results in an estimated increase in revenue on
the order of $100K/year for both sites.
However, we find little evidence that posts with Wikipedia
links provide direct value to the Wikipedia community. We
were able to replicate work that showed that Wikipedia posts
on the popular Reddit community “TIL” (“Today I
Learned”) were responsible for a large spike in viewership.
However, our results suggest that this large effect does not
generalize beyond the “TIL” community or beyond Reddit.

Moreover, we see negligible increases in Wikipedia edits and
editor signup despite the large volume of links posted on both
sites. Through a smaller-scale qualitative analysis, we find
evidence that suggests that the “paradox of re-use” [51] may
be playing a role here: Wikipedia’s permissive content
licenses make it easy for Reddit and SO users to directly
include the Wikipedia content in their posts, which could be
mitigating the benefits of Wikipedia links in terms of traffic
to Wikipedia and new Wikipedia edits/editors.
As we discuss below, these results have important
implications for a number of constituencies. For companies
that rely on Wikipedia content, our findings highlight the
value (including both engagement and revenue) created by
Wikipedia’s free and volunteer-created content. For
Wikipedia and its editors, RQ1’s results further demonstrate
the critical role the Wikipedia community plays in the
broader online ecosystem outside of Wikipedia. However,
our RQ2 results present more challenging implications for
the Wikipedia community: these results highlight the need
for further research on solutions to the paradox of re-use.
BACKGROUND

Prior to presenting related work, we first provide high-level
context about Reddit, SO and how Wikipedia content
appears on these sites. For both Reddit and SO, there is a
class of posts that is highly-dependent (if not entirely reliant)
on Wikipedia content (i.e. the posts could not exist without
Wikipedia). Additionally, users can “upvote” and
“downvote” content on Reddit and SO, which gives it a
“score” (# of upvotes – # of downvotes).
Reddit and Wikipedia

Reddit is a large-scale online community that allows users to
share links to external content (e.g. news articles, images,
videos), post original text content (e.g. questions, opinions),
and discuss this content through comments. As of July 2017,
Reddit is the ninth-most-visited website globally [1], has
300M monthly visitors, and has a $1.8B valuation [64].
On Reddit, links to Wikipedia often appear in the wellknown “TIL” (Today I Learned) “subreddit”, among others.
The term “subreddit” refers to the sub-communities that

together make up Reddit. Many posts in “TIL” are composed
of only a Wikipedia link and a short summary or quote from
the article. An example TIL post is shown in Figure 1.
Stack Overflow and Wikipedia

SO is a Q&A community for programmers and the 56thmost-visited website in the world [1]. Stack Exchange, the
company that owns SO, raised $40M of venture capital
funding in 2015, bringing it to a total of $70M raised [65].
On SO, Wikipedia supports answers in the form of links and
quoted text. Answers often use technical terms or acronyms
and include a Wikipedia link in lieu of defining these terms.
An example post that uses a Wikipedia link and quote to
support an answer is shown in Figure 2.
RELATED WORK
Wikipedia and Its Internet Ecosystem

This research project was directly motivated by two recent
developments related to Wikipedia and its broader Internet
ecosystem. First, the Wikimedia Foundation called on
Wikipedia researchers to focus on these relationships as part
of a “New Research Agenda” for Wikipedia [51]. Second,
recent work further substantiated this call with new evidence
showing how critical these relationships can be, both for
Wikipedia and for the Web more generally [35].
With respect to the former, Dario Taraborelli – the Head of
Research at Wikimedia – urged the large community of
Wikipedia researchers to refocus their efforts on several new
opportunities and challenges facing Wikipedia. One of those
challenges is better understanding how Wikipedia (and
Wikidata) content is used by external entities, the importance
of this content to those entities, and the effect on Wikipedia
(and Wikidata) of this external use. One concern of
Taraborelli’s is that the increasing re-use of Wikipedia
content outside of Wikipedia will reduce traffic to
Wikipedia. This would weaken Wikipedia’s editor base over
the long term, thus diminishing the re-use value of Wikipedia
content. Taraborelli called this phenomenon the “paradox of
re-use”. We return to this concern below.
Recent work by McMahon et al. [35] provided clear evidence
to substantiate Taraborelli’s argument about the importance
of understanding Wikipedia’s relationships with its broader
ecosystem. McMahon et al. found that click-through rates on
Google SERPs drop dramatically when Wikipedia links are
removed, and that Google is the mediator for the majority of
observed Wikipedia traffic.
In addition to the direct implications for Google and
Wikipedia, McMahon et al.’s study raised new questions for
both the social computing community and the broader
computing literature. For social computing, the amount of
traffic to Wikipedia mediated by Google means that any
changes to Google’s presentation of Wikipedia content may
have enormous effects on key variables of interest for those
studying Wikipedia’s peer production process, e.g., new
editor recruitment and retention [7,17,18,62]. For the broader

computing literature (especially information retrieval),
McMahon et al. found that the effect size of the presence of
Wikipedia content was much larger than many algorithmic
search improvements. More generally, this finding
demonstrated how important social computing phenomena
like peer production can be for addressing core problems in
other areas of computing like addressing user information
needs in web search.
In this paper, we seek to expand on McMahon et al.’s work
beyond search engines by considering Wikipedia’s
relationship with other large-scale online communities. We
believed large-scale online communities would be an
optimal domain to help follow-up McMahon et al.’s work for
two reasons: (1) we anecdotally observed that this
relationship may be particularly salient and (2) several
research papers have provided early evidence that our
anecdotal observations may generalize [15,40]. We also
expand McMahon et al.’s lens to consider the quality of the
associated Wikipedia content, i.e. does higher quality content
create more value for external websites? This question
provides further insight into how Wikipedia’s internal
quality metrics (and therefore investment of community
effort) map to external value.
The early evidence that motivated us to examine large-scale
online communities primarily came from two papers: Moyer
et al. [40] and Gómez et al. [15]. Moyer et al. examined the
causal effect of Reddit posts on Wikipedia page views and
found that sharing Wikipedia content on Reddit’s TIL
community increased page views to the corresponding
Wikipedia articles. Below, we replicate this result, but find
that it does not generalize to other subreddits. While studying
the role of links on SO with regards to innovation diffusion
in the software engineering space, Gómez et al. [15] found
an intriguing peripheral result: Wikipedia links were the
second most common external link on SO. While we also
observed that Wikipedia links are very common on SO, we
found little direct evidence that SO is contributing
substantial value to Wikipedia.
UGC and the Physical World

Through our research, we also seek estimate the economic
impact of Wikipedia content on external entities. This lens
on our results was motivated by very recent findings from
Hinnosaar et al. [24], which showed that improvements to
Wikipedia article content about places in Spain directly
increased tourism revenue in those places [24]. Analogous
results have also been identified with types of user-generated
content (UGC) other than Wikipedia (e.g. [6,34]).
Factors Influencing Content Value

A key methodological challenge in our causal analyses
below is identifying potential confounding factors for the
substantial increases in value we see associated with
Wikipedia-linked content on Reddit and SO. For example,
users who post Wikipedia links may also write longer posts,
and longer posts may be more popular. To search for
potential confounds, we turned to the burgeoning literature


on Reddit, SO, and other large-scale online communities. We
present the literature used to guide model decisions here, and
summarize in greater detail how these factors were
operationalized in the Methods section.
Specific factors influencing value on Reddit

From platform-specific work on Reddit, we identified three
major factors that can influence user votes (score), a value
metric that we use in this paper. Previous work identified
content type [31] and title characteristics [23] as predictive
of score on Reddit. Additionally, Gilbert showed that content
posted multiple times (i.e. a particular image) that received a
high score on later postings was often “missed” on early
postings [14], implying that popularity is highly contextual,
and not necessarily purely dependent on content itself.
Specific factors influencing value on SO

We also identified three factors that influence content value
on SO. Anderson et al. found that contextual information,
such as user reputation and time of arrival, were predictive
of the long-term value of SO pages as measured by page
views [2]. Ponzanelli et al. [43] showed that that adding
readability metrics to simple textual metrics (e.g. percent
uppercase, number of characters) improved low-quality post
detection. Finally, Calefato et al. [5] identified promptness,
presence of a hyperlink, presence of a code snippet, and
answer sentiment as key predictors of an answer’s likelihood
to be selected as the best answer by the questioner.
Research on other question and answer (Q&A) sites also
helped to inform our model design. On Math Overflow, a
math-focused version of SO, both online reputation (points)
and offline reputation (number of publications) were found
to influence content popularity [52]. Harper et al. studied a
variety of sites including Yahoo! Answers and identified that
the number of hyperlinks in an answer was an indicator of
answer quality [19]. We emphasize this potential confound
in our analysis to understand the value that Wikipedia links
add beyond the value added by the presence of links overall.
METHODS

In this section, we first present the two aspects of our
methodology that cut across our investigations of both
research questions: (1) data collection and (2) handling of
current events. We then describe our methodology specific
to Study One (RQ1) and Study Two (RQ2).
Datasets

We downloaded database tables corresponding to every
Reddit post in 2016 from pushshift.io as hosted on Google
BigQuery (metadata, i.e. the latest score, last updated July
2017 [66]). We also leveraged the Reddit API to obtain user
information [67]. We used BigQuery to download full
database tables for all SO questions, users, and answers,
starting July 31, 2008 and ending June 11, 2017 [66].
Following statistical best practice [44], we separated the
analysis into two phases: an initial phase for developing the
methods and a testing phase for generating results. As we
describe below, many of our analyses required using

multiple rate-limited APIs (e.g. for calculating features for
our causal analyses), so we employed random sampling to
minimize API endpoint load and to make query times
tractable. For each platform and phase, we used a random
sample composed of ~1M posts from the entire dataset
(1.10% of all Reddit posts and 4.46% of all SO posts) and, in
the testing phase, an additional ~40K posts from the subset
of Wikipedia-linking posts (to ensure that we had adequate
Wikipedia links to pages of each class of article quality).
Defining “Value”

The concept of “value” is central to both of our research
questions, i.e. the value that Wikipedia is providing largescale online communities and the value that these
communities are contributing to Wikipedia. In this paper, we
seek to increase robustness and detect potentially interesting
nuances by operationalizing the notion of value through
multiple metrics rather than using just one (e.g. page views).
Specifically, we measure post value in RQ1 through four
metrics. The first three metrics are user engagement
statistics: (1) Score, equal to upvotes minus downvotes, (2)
Comments, the number of comments a post receives, (3)
Page Views, the number of views a post receives. To
contextualize these metrics, we also calculate (4) Revenue,
or the financial gain generated by Wikipedia posts. Revenue
is calculated directly from the engagement statistics using
publicly-available financial information (described in detail
in Study 1 – Results). In the case of Reddit (which does not
release page view data), it is important to note that score
controls post visibility and correlates with page views [50].
With respect to RQ2, we assess the value that Wikipedia
receives from external communities as contributions to the
editing community and increased readership. Specifically,
we measure this value with four metrics that capture changes
in edits, editors, and viewership in a given week: (1) Edit
Count is the number of times an article was edited, (2)
Editors Gained is the number of new editors who edited an
article, (3) Editors Retained is the number of new editors
who made another edit in the future (we measured at one
month and six months later, following past research on editor
retention [7,39]), and (4) Article Page Views is the number
of views that each Wikipedia article received. To capture the
effect of Reddit and SO on Wikipedia, we calculated the
metrics for the week before and the week after each post
containing a Wikipedia link.
Influence of Current Events

One potential confound of all our measurements is the
impact of current events on our value metrics. For instance,
if Reddit users happened to post Wikipedia links related to
current events, then any subsequent increase in Wikipedia
page views might be largely driven by current events and not
by the Reddit post. We predicted, however, that very few
posts with Wikipedia links on either platform are related to
current events because SO is strictly for programming
discussion and the Reddit TIL community does not allow
current events posts [68].


To formally verify this assumption, we performed a
qualitative coding exercise. Following standard practices
[41], we used a small (10 posts per site) calibration procedure
with two researchers, achieved a 90% agreement, and then
one researcher classified an additional 100 posts per site. In
this qualitative analysis, we identified that only 5% of
Wikipedia-linked Reddit posts were related to current events,
and no Wikipedia-influenced Stack Overflow posts were
related to current events. This gave us confidence that our
results were largely not driven by current events.

to a casual reader” [71]. Specifically, we define our highquality and low-quality groups as follows:

STUDY ONE

We cannot know how SO and Reddit would function in a
world without Wikipedia. Therefore, we draw upon wellestablished causal inference methods (e.g. [27,46]) that
estimate the loss in value that would occur to these
communities if posts with Wikipedia links were replaced
with a range of alternatives (i.e. counterfactuals). In other
words, we consider how SO and Reddit would be affected if
they were not “treated” by Wikipedia content under a series
of different assumptions. This approach provides a
reasonable upper-bound, middle-ground, and lower-bound
estimate of the value contributed by the Wikipedia
community to SO and Reddit. In our consideration of the
effect of Wikipedia article quality, we take a similar
approach and estimate the loss in value if links to highquality Wikipedia articles were replaced with a range of
alternatives. We emphasize that causal analyses, the
statistical methods we employ, can estimate causal effects
with confounding effects reduced, but not eliminated (as in a
randomized controlled trial) [27,46].

Our first study targets RQ1, or “What value is Wikipedia
providing to other large-scale online communities like Stack
Overflow and Reddit?” Here, we present the methodology
specific to this question and then present our results.
Study One – Methods
Controls and Treatments

In Study 1, our goal is to estimate the value that Wikipedia
provides to SO and Reddit. We study value through two
separate analyses. The various estimates are summarized in
Table 1. First, we estimate the effects that the presence of
Wikipedia links has on value. We then estimate the effects
that Wikipedia article quality has on value. For each analysis,
following standard practice, we label the change in value in
the treatment group – the group associated with Wikipedia
content – the “treatment effect”. We defined three groups:
• Has Wikipedia Link: posts with at least one valid link to
Wikipedia (as described below, this amounts to 0.13% of
all Reddit posts and 1.28% of all SO posts).
• Has Other Link: posts with at least one external link, but
no links to Wikipedia (49.1% of all Reddit posts and
31.2% of all SO posts).
• No External Link: posts with no external links at all
(50.8% of all Reddit posts and 67.5% of all SO posts).
To estimate the effects of Wikipedia article quality on value
to Reddit and SO (the second half of RQ1), we further
subdivide the Has Wikipedia Link group into high-quality
and low-quality groups. While there are many definitions of
quality on Wikipedia [55], we rely on revision-specific
predictions of quality along English Wikipedia’s internal
assessment scale [69] as produced by Wikimedia’s ORES
API [70]. Following Johnson et al. [29], we use the “C”-class
assessment as a minimum assessment for a high-quality
article because “C”-class articles are the first that are “useful

•

C-class or Better: All posts with any links to C-class or
higher articles are in this group (79% of all Wikipedialinked Reddit posts and 77% of all Wikipedia-linked SO
posts).

•

Below C-class: All posts in which all Wikipedia links
are to articles below C-class are in this group.

Simulating a World without Wikipedia (Counterfactuals)

Upper-bound Estimates: Our upper-bound estimate of the
value created by Wikipedia on SO and Reddit assumes that
without Wikipedia, all posts containing a Wikipedia link
would not exist (i.e. would not have been generated). For our
analysis of quality, we make an analogous assumption: we
calculate the value that would be lost if all posts containing
high-quality articles did not exist. This upper bound is simply
equivalent to the value of all “treated” posts.
Middle-ground Estimates: The middle-ground estimate
corresponds to the value that would be lost if the links to
treated articles were completely replaced with an identical
post with no links. In other words, this scenario assumes that
the links to Wikipedia were removed, but the post still exists.
Lower-bound Estimates: A lower-bound for value
contributed by Wikipedia can be obtained by estimating the
value that would be lost if the links to Wikipedia article were

replaced with links to alternative external domains. In other
words, the lower-bound scenario assumes that the exact same
post (with alternative links) could be written without
Wikipedia, and so the added value is solely from Wikipedia’s
reputation or other factors associated with Wikipedia (in
comparison to other websites). In the quality analysis, the
lower bound is the estimate of value that would be lost if
links to high-quality articles were replaced with links to lowquality articles (without other changes).

Causal Analysis

While the upper-bound estimate is relatively easy to
calculate using descriptive statistics, our middle-ground and
lower-bound estimates require the estimation of formal
counterfactuals, which calls for causal analysis techniques.
One of the first steps in casual analysis is to consider other
potential causal factors, i.e. other reasons that Wikipediatreated posts may have increased in value besides the
Wikipedia treatment. To address this challenge, we turned to
the literature on factors associated with content value,
discussed above in Related Work and summarized in Table
2. This review broadly shows that value may come from four
sources other than Wikipedia itself: user characteristics (e.g.
users with high reputation), stylistic and structural
characteristics (e.g. long posts, posts with code snippets,
posts with punctuation), post timing (e.g. posting on a certain
day of the week), and the presence of any external link.
We operationalize these potential alternative causal factors
through the calculation of features that capture them. Some
of these features are numerical (e.g. post length) and others
are dummy variables (e.g. whether the post includes code
snippets). While most of these features were very
straightforward to calculate (e.g. title length), readability and
sentiment were more complex. With respect to readability,
we use the Coleman-Liau index [8], which was used by
Ponzanelli et al. [43]. For sentiment, we used the TextBlob
library [33], which leverages sentiment analysis models
(trained on customer review text) from the well-performing
[45] library “Pattern” [49] to estimate objectivity and
polarity. Additionally, we log-transform reputation and
response time as they are otherwise highly-skewed variables.
Further details about these implementations are available in
our source code, which we have made publicly accessible for
download1.
In terms of our statistical approach to causal analyses, we
performed four propensity-score-stratified regressions2. This
method, originally described by Rosenbaum and Rubin [46]
has been used in the context of HCI for many purposes and
is an approach advocated for in the HCI community (e.g.
[10,11,42,63]). We controlled for the potential alternative
causal factors – user, style, structure, and timing – and then
estimate the effect of including a Wikipedia link, a non1

Wikipedia link, a high-quality Wikipedia link, and a lowquality Wikipedia link.
By finding the difference between corresponding estimates
(Has Wiki Link vs Has Other Link and C-class or Better vs
Below C-class), we produce a robust estimate of the value
that Wikipedia uniquely provides, and the value that highquality articles uniquely provide. This estimate is minimally
affected by bias from hidden variables or incorrect model
assumptions because this bias should affect the
corresponding regressions equally. For instance, if there was
a hidden variable at play (perhaps users have a general
unwillingness to visit external domains), that would affect
posts with Wikipedia links and posts with external links
equally and be removed by taking the difference.
The propensity score of a given post is an estimated
probability that the post was “treated” based on all available
covariates. In our case, the covariates are the computed
features summarized in Table 2 (except for the number of
hyperlinks, which relates directly to whether there is a
Wikipedia link). The actual propensity score for each post is
calculated by logistic regression and represents how likely a
given post is to include a Wikipedia link (or a good
Wikipedia link) based only on its features. Posts that have
features that are commonly found in Wikipedia-linked posts
will therefore have high propensity scores.
Using the open-source causalinference [72] library, we
stratify [3] our datasets by propensity score (subdivide into
many subsets) in order to emulate a randomized blocked trial
using observational data. Each stratum contains posts with a
small range of propensity scores, so posts have similar
features with each stratum, which reduces the standardized
bias (described by Rosenbaum and Rubin [47]). To

To check robustness, we also performed propensity score matching [3] and
propensity score stratification with covariate overlap adjustment [9] and
confirmed that these methods led to the same conclusions.


determine the number of strata and propensity scores for
each stratum, we use a bin-selection algorithm described by
Imbens and Rubin [27] and implemented in [72].
We performed a multivariate linear regression separately for
each stratum, extracted the treatment coefficient, and then
computed a weighted average of the treatment coefficients
based on the number of treated items in each stratum. In other
words, a coefficient from a stratum with more Wikipedia
links than another stratum will be given greater weight in
determining the estimated effect. The weighted average is
the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), which
is the main result we present. This value represents how
much value would be lost if all the treatment posts were
replaced with control posts with nearly the same covariates.
The analysis of SO page views requires special handling
because page views correspond to one question page, which
could have many associated SO answers. This means we
must take care to avoid overestimating page view effects.
When computing mean page views for the upper-bound
estimate, we only count each question once. In our causal
analysis (i.e. middle-ground and lower-bound estimate), we
make a conservative assumption that all page views are
attributed to the top-scoring answer for a question, which
means that only top answers are included in this analysis.
Study 1 – Results

In this section, we first present high-level descriptive
statistics about the relationships between Wikipedia and SO
and Reddit (e.g. # of Wikipedia-linked posts). We then
present the results from our core analyses for RQ1.

Descriptive Results

Overall, we were surprised to find that Wikipedia links
represent only 0.13% of posted content on Reddit. However,
further examining this result, we found that Wikipedia links
are substantially over-represented in high-value locations.
For instance, Wikipedia is the third most-linked site (after
YouTube and Imgur) on the ten most-popular subreddits.
This relatively low-quantity/high-quality dynamic is one we
see frequently in our formal analyses below.
On SO, Wikipedia links appear in 1.28% of posts, but this
makes them the fourth-most-common type of external link
(after github.com, msdn.microsoft.com, and the popular
“code playground” jsfiddle.net). Notably, github and jsfiddle
are used to share code, and msdn is Microsoft’s code
documentation library, meaning that Wikipedia is the most
important conceptual reference for programming on SO.
Effects of Wikipedia-linked content on Post Value

The results from our full analysis to address RQ1 are
presented in Table 3. Below, we unpack the main trends in
Table 3, as well as discuss the implications of Table 3 with
respect to Wikipedia’s aggregate impact on SO and Reddit.
Effects on Reddit posts: Table 3a shows that Wikipedialinked posts on Reddit are exceptionally valuable. To a post’s
score, Wikipedia adds between 108 points (ATT, Δ in Table
3a) and 151 points (Mean Values: Has WP Link, with a
middle-ground estimate of 141 points (ATT: Has WP Link
vs No External Link). Relative to the average post’s score of
30 points, this is a 4x-5x increase. Aggregating these
findings across all 120K Wikipedia-linked posts from 2016,
this means that Wikipedia is responsible for an increase in

user-voted score of between 13.1M and 18.4M points in
2016 (up to 0.7% of all points on the site).
Additionally, Table 3a also shows that Wikipedia adds 1119 comments per post. This means Wikipedia-linked posts
generate twice as much discussion as average posts. In total,
this amounted to between 1.3M and 2.3M comments in 2016.
Effects on Stack Overflow posts: For SO, Table 3a displays
a similar trend to what we saw with Reddit. For instance,
Wikipedia-linked content on SO adds 2.9-6.5 points per post,
with a middle ground of about 3.4 points. This means that
Wikipedia-linked answers are roughly twice as valuable as
other answers and, across the 280K Wikipedia-linked
answers on SO, increased total score between 0.8M and
1.7M points. This score increase is accompanied by a page
view increase of 954-3473 per question, with a middle
ground of 1337. Estimating based on the 12K questions with
Wikipedia-linked answers in our page view analysis,
Wikipedia may have added 64M to 234M views (which we
use for revenue estimation). However, we see no evidence of
an effect on SO comments.
Overall, the presented estimates show that even assuming all
authors could continue writing the same posts, except with
non-Wikipedia alternative links, Wikipedia still adds
significant value (i.e. through its brand or other factors).
Effect of Wikipedia Article Quality

Compared to posts that only have links to Below C-class
Wikipedia articles, we find mixed evidence that links to Cclass or Better articles contribute to value. Relative to BelowC-class articles, C-class or Better articles add 61-163 points
on Reddit (1.5-1.5x increase). Similarly, C-class or Better
articles also add 8-21 comments on Reddit (1.6-1.6x
increase). However, we observe no effect on SO score,
comments, or page views.
The above results suggest that article quality for the purposes
of the SO community may mean something different than
article quality for the Wikipedia community (and Reddit).
For instance, SO members may not differentiate between the
value of short or stub-like articles and longer, high-quality
articles, as long as those articles contain a specific piece of
desired technical information.
Back-of-the-Napkin Revenue Estimation

To better understand how the results of Study 1 translate into
real-world revenue for SO and Reddit, we use the following
“back-of-the-napkin” revenue estimations, incorporating as
much actual public financial information as possible and
making conservative assumptions (e.g. assuming all SO ads
were sold for the lowest price listed). Both platforms sell ads
at a fixed cost per thousand impressions and therefore
revenue scales linearly with page views.
Estimating Reddit’s 2016 ad revenue is relatively simple, as
Reddit only makes money from ads and Reddit Gold (a
subscription service). Using Reddit’s $20M revenue
projection [73] and an approximation of $1M revenue from

“Reddit Gold” [63], we presume a total ad revenue of $19M.
To obtain a rough figure for Stack Overflow’s total revenue
from 2008-2016, we use the following equation:
𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑆𝑂 = (𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠 − 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠) ∗

𝑎𝑑𝑠 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡
∗
∗ 𝑎𝑑𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘
𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠 𝑎𝑑

The (𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠 − 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠) accounts for the fact that high
reputation users see reduced ads [75] (we conservatively
assume that every vote was made by a high reputation user,
and therefore the corresponding view should not be included
in ad revenue). We also multiply by an “adblock coefficient”
of 0.75 to account for the 25% of desktop users who block
advertisements [76]. We conservatively assumed all ads cost
$0.00466 [77], the lowest price listed in August 2017 and
that users see only two impressions per page (users who
scroll down actually see three).
Finally, because Reddit page view data is not available, we
estimate page views using score, based on research showing
that the score of a Reddit post correlates with views [50].
Overall, under these conservative assumptions, we estimate
that in 2016, Wikipedia was responsible for between
$114,500 and $124,200 of Reddit’s revenue, and from 2008
to 2017, Wikipedia annually was responsible for between
$49,700 and $180,900 of SO’s annual revenue.
In total, considering only the content analyzed from two
communities and the limited time periods we studied (nine
years of SO activity and only one year of Reddit activity),
Wikipedia may have been (conservatively) responsible for
about $1.7 million in revenue, entirely from volunteer work
of the community.
STUDY 2

In this section, we present a study that addresses RQ2, or
“What value do Reddit and SO provide to Wikipedia?” For
the before-and-after windows for each post (one week each),
we calculated the Edit Count, Editors Gained, Editors
Retained, and Article Page Views (reported daily by the
Wikipedia page view API), as discussed above.
Study 2 – Results

Table 4 shows the full results of our quantitative before-andafter investigation into RQ2.
The clearest trend in Table 4 is the near-absence of any
significant results for both edit behavior and page views.
With regard to edit behavior, on both platforms, we did not
observe a significant increase in editors gained or editors
retained during the week after a Wikipedia-linking post
appeared. While we did observe an effect for the number of
edits from Reddit posts, this effect is quite small (about 1 edit
per 2 posts). If we consider all the Wikipedia-linking Reddit
posts from 2016, this amounts to about 0.002 edits per
second. Compared to Wikipedia’s 10 edits per second [78],
this effect is largely negligible. We did observe one minor
significant effect that warrants discussion: Low-quality
articles (“Stub” and “Start”) were edited enough to achieve a
statistically significant increase in edits relative to high-

quality articles, even on SO where no other effects were
observed. The effect was only 0.04 edits per post, but the
presence of this small effect suggests that lower-quality
articles received proportionally more contribution from
Reddit and SO. We discuss the implications below.
During this analysis, we also analyzed the effect of Reddit
posts exclusively from the TIL community on Wikipedia
page views, a replication of work by Moyer et al. that used
2012 Reddit data [40]. In this specific case, we found the
increase in page views corresponded with previous results.
However, when including posts from outside TIL and when
looking at SO, we found that the increase in page views was
not statistically significant, indicating that while this result
replicates, it may not generalize (we note that we used the
Wikipedia pageview API, which returns daily statistics,
whereas Moyer et al. used hourly page views). In other
words, we saw no evidence that an arbitrary link to a
Wikipedia page on Reddit and SO significantly increases
traffic to the Wikipedia page in the week following.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Paradox of Re-use

As noted above, a concern that has been raised within the
Wikipedia community is the “paradox of re-use” – i.e. that
the quality of Wikipedia’s content and Wikipedia’s editor
base could decline over the long term through the external
re-use of Wikipedia content (and that the re-using parties
would then suffer as well) [51]. This concern leads to the
question of whether Wikipedia needs to adapt its permissive
licensing to survive, especially as its content is increasingly
appearing on platforms more than a “click away” (e.g. voice
assistants). Given that we observed that Wikipedia-linking
posts were receiving a great deal of attention and
engagement on SO and Reddit, we were surprised that so
little of this attention and engagement was returned to
Wikipedia in the form of page views, edits, and editors. We
hypothesized that the paradox of re-use may be a factor.
To understand exactly how SO and Reddit use content from
Wikipedia, we performed a small-scale qualitative coding
exercise. Using the same approach to qualitative coding as
the current events analysis, we classified whether each post
matched the following definition of direct re-use: “Has text
(quoted or summarized) from article.” Two authors
conducted a calibration coding and achieved reasonable
inter-rater agreement (Reddit: Cohen’s κ = 0.74, 90%
agreement; SO: Cohen’s κ = 0.62; 90% agreement), and then
one author coded 100 posts with Wikipedia links per site.

Our coding analysis revealed that 79% of Reddit posts had
quoted or summarized text from the linked Wikipedia article,
whereas this was true of 33% of SO posts. This result shows
that many posts can be characterized by “direct re-use”.
These early results help to expand our understanding of the
nature of the “paradox of re-use” from McMahon et al. [35].
McMahon et al. found causal evidence for the paradox of reuse on Google – i.e. Knowledge Card assets in Google search
results were capturing views that would have otherwise gone
to Wikipedia. This indicates a “strong” version of the
paradox of re-use, in which Google was capturing traffic that
would have gone to Wikipedia. Our (associative) results
suggest that a “weak” form of the paradox may be occurring
in Reddit and SO: the Wikipedia links on Reddit and SO
posts might have generated new traffic for Wikipedia (rather
than capturing existing traffic), but the re-use of content
directly in Reddit and SO may be mitigating this effect.
However, it is critical to note that our results merely allow
this as a possibility: future work should test this hypothesis
directly, ideally through experimental approaches.
Broadening Peer Production Research

At a high level, the results of Study 1 demonstrate that there
are important relationships between different peerproduction communities (with Reddit and SO themselves
being peer production communities). We see that when
content creators on Reddit and SO leverage existing peerproduced content (i.e. Wikipedia) to create new content in
their communities, some of the “value” transfers and the
magnitude of that value is reflective of the re-used content’s
quality (in this case, the quality of Wikipedia articles). In
other words, Reddit and SO users can take advantage of the
work already performed by the Wikipedia community to post
higher value content in their communities with less effort.
These relationships between peer production communities
have important implications for research. Studies of some
important variables such as content quality may want to
consider external dependencies and implications, e.g.
Wikipedia article quality matters well outside of Wikipedia,
adding importance to the body of work that studies
Wikipedia quality and how to improve it [7,18,55,56,62,70].
Coverage Biases and External Entities

The work on Wikipedia content biases is another key
research area in the Wikipedia literature that our results
suggest should be examined with a broader lens. Wikipedia
(and other UGC communities) have been shown to overfocus on some topics and under-focus on others, particularly


along the lines of gender (e.g. [22,37,54]), geography (e.g.
[20,29]), and language (e.g. [21]). Importantly, our results
suggest that these biases may be having ripple effects around
the web, including on SO and Reddit. For instance, the
findings from Study 1 indicate that these biases mean that the
TIL community on Reddit is working from a dataset that
disadvantages women, certain geographies (e.g. rural areas
[29]), and topics outside of the cultural sphere of most
English speakers. Any posts about these Wikipediadisadvantaged topics that do appear on TIL are less likely to
have a Wikipedia link (or high-quality link) available, and
thus cannot get the benefits of that link.
There is a potential silver lining regarding coverage biases:
while the number of edits contributed to Wikipedia from
Reddit that we observed in Study 2 was quite small in the
context of Wikipedia as a whole, it may be that this effect
would be meaningful if applied to specific under-covered
content areas. For instance, if more Wikipedia links were
posted on a subreddit for rural issues, the throughput of edits
that is quite small for all of Wikipedia could make non-trivial
improvements to coverage of some rural topics, for which a
small number of edits is a large relative increase in edits.
One could also imagine the Wikipedia community (e.g.
WikiProject leaders) working with the moderators of
subreddits in under-covered areas on intentional “quality
improvement projects” [55]. This might involve rallying
these subreddits to encourage edits to relevant Wikipedia
articles and to encourage members to become long-term
editors. It would be interesting to compare the results of such
an effort to our findings, which would provide an excellent
baseline to determine if the effort was effective.
Implications for Reddit and Stack Overflow

McMahon et al.’s work [35] indicated that financially
supporting Wikipedia may be highly incentivized for search
companies, and our work suggests that the same might be
true for Reddit and SO (although to a lesser degree). In other
words, our results suggest that by donating to Wikipedia,
entities like SO and Reddit can not only garner goodwill, but
also could feasibly see a return on investment. In general,
donations to support staffing and infrastructure are an
understudied aspect of the peer production process,
especially relative to their importance. Our results indicate
that one direction of research in this space that might be
fruitful is identifying formal value propositions for external
consumers of peer-produced content.
Our results also suggest that Reddit and SO design
interventions could help increase the mutual value of
Wikipedia-SO and Wikipedia-Reddit relationships. For
instance, Reddit and SO could implement a feature that
detects when linked peer produced content is low quality or
under-covered and directly encourage users to contribute. By
improving Wikipedia content, this would in turn add value
to the Reddit and SO and could even be gamified, e.g. giving
extra Reddit/SO “karma” when users contribute. Similarly,
to facilitate higher-quality posts on Reddit and SO, topic

modeling could also be used to suggest related Wikipedia
articles to improve post quality.
FUTURE WORK AND LIMITATIONS

An important direct extension of this work would be to
attempt to replicate our causal analysis on observational data
with a randomized experiment. However, experiment-driven
posting behavior could be seen as deviant by the SO and
Reddit communities, so ethical and ecological validity
challenges should be carefully considered.
Secondly, while the “back of the napkin” estimations of
revenue above provide a minor contribution to understanding
the economic implications of volunteer peer-produced
content, much more work is needed in this area. This paper,
along with prior research [35], suggests that volunteers’
content creation efforts generate important economic value
well outside the corresponding communities. Understanding
this value could provide intrinsic motivation for volunteers
and incentivize donations from beneficiaries. Some
economists even believe that better understanding this value
could produce improved national GDP estimates [4].
However, moving forward in this space will be difficult
because many of the corporate beneficiaries of volunteercreated content do not release the necessary information for
rigorous estimates. As such, new methods that go beyond our
“back of the napkin” approach will likely be necessary, such
as using targeted ad buys to estimate actual revenue,
advancing techniques similar to those of Cabañas et al. [16],
and attempting to measure the value of volunteer-created
content to profitable machine learning systems.
Finally, given that most of our results were not communityspecific but rather generalized across Reddit and SO, similar
relationships likely exist between Wikipedia and other
discussion-based communities (e.g. akin to Reddit:
Hackernews, Facebook groups; akin to SO: Quora, Yahoo!
Answers). Future work should seek to examine these
relationships, as well as those between these communities
and peer-produced data repositories like OpenStreetMap.
CONCLUSION

In this paper, we presented results that identify and quantify
relationships between Wikipedia and the large-scale
communities Reddit and Stack Overflow. In general, we
observe a one-way relationship in which Wikipediainfluenced content adds value to the external communities,
but no evidence of substantial contributions in the reverse
direction is observed. This research highlights the value of
examining online communities using a broad lens, as crosscommunity relationships can have large effects.
