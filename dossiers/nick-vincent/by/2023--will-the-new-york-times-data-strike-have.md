# Will the New York Times Data Strike Have a Large Impact on ChatGPT?

## Full text

In a previous post, I discussed how the decision by the New York
Times to opt out of large language model (LLM) training might be a sign
that we’re entering the era of the data strike, and a new paradigm for
content creation and sharing.

Since that article was posted, we have indeed seen a large number of
organizations follow
suit. As of September 28th, there’s at least 490 news organizations
who have asked GPTBot to stay away.

Then, we saw another development: the announcement of browsing-enabled
ChatGPT, which may seriously change the incentives around how
organizations want their content platforms to connect with LLM
technologies. This will likely warrant its own post, as the sudden
potential to see traffic from ChatGPT is likely to reshape the decision
landscape, in ways that may hearken back to early discussions about
search engines and content.

With these developments top of mind, an important question is likely
top of mind for the NYT and other opting-out news organizations: when
will a data strike be impactful?

We might also consider the very broad version of this question: for a
variety of different groups we might imagine conducting a data strike
(e.g. “just the New York Times”, “a coalition of all major newspapers”,
“everyone in the United States”), how does potential impact (what we’ve
called “data
leverage power”) vary?

Across these groups, we’d expect to see a distribution of different
data leverage power values: everyone in the US banding together to opt
out would have quite a large impact on ChatGPT (and co.), and if I begin
a one-person data strike by myself, it will have basically no impact.
Other groups fall somewhere in between.

What the NYT probably cares about is this: “Is our content
sufficiently impactful that the loss of our data will meet some
threshold of performance loss such that OpenAI or others want to
negotiate with us?” In other words, “Do we have enough
leverage?”

While answering this question requires a great deal of effort (and is
a topic of ongoing research), I think we can actually draw some insight
from earlier research we
conducted on data strikes in the context of recommender systems. There,
we saw different subgroups of movie fans (e.g. “film noir fans”, “comedy
fans”) were quite varied in terms of their ability to “punch above their
weight”. In some cases, it seems niche groups could have outsized
impact. In the extreme, a group of film noir fans could band together to
make a recommender system “unlearn” the existence of film noir as a
genre.

One key takeaway from that research is that our ability to evaluate
the impacts of data strikes is highly dependent on the extent to which a
given data strike might change the test sets that AI developers use. In
other words, there’s an issue of circularity: evaluating LLM performance
(and AI performance in general) requires a stable “test set”: opt out
decisions will invariably change this test set and thus fundamentally
impact our very definition of “AI capabilities”.

One very interesting possibility is that a particularly large data
strike might prevent an AI developer from even testing their
model in a certain context (because, e.g. they have no journalistic
content to create a journalism focused benchmark).

Transferring this insight from the movie recommendation domain to the
news domain, this suggests that content like news may have two distinct
sources of value: the easy to measure impact of making a technology
aware of an event (i.e., value as a knowledge base) and the hard measure
impact on broad LLM capabilities (i.e., value from teaching ChatGPT to
write like a journalist). If my outlet is the only outlet that covered a
news story and I withhold my content, LLMs won’t know about that event
(though in time, other outlets will presumably cover the event as
well).

### Data
strike impact might be threatened by other “similar content” on the
web

LLMs use much, much, much bigger training datasets than academic
movie recommender experiments. But, I’d conjecture that there’s a shared
concept that unites data strikes against a small movie recommender and a
data strikes against a large language model: a group’s ability to
effectively data strike relates to how much of the full dataset’s
“similar content” the group itself covers. The intuition here is this:
if the NYT goes on strike, but the LA Times and Washington Post don’t,
ChatGPT’s general capabilities of “write in a journalistic style” might
not see much of a dip (though the disappearance “exclusive coverage”
from the NYT might make a big splash).

A key idea here is that for any given set of content we might produce
as individuals or part of a group, there’s probably some other set of
content out there that can serve as a substitute. We must acknowledge
this fact as we think about data-related negotiations in this new era of
content.

Put simply, some documents are “closer” (in some sense) to each other
than to other documents; the New York Times articles are all close to
each other, probably pretty close to LA Times articles, and probably
decently far from something like a long legal paper or a Twitter
thread.

It probably matters that when attempting a data strike aimed at
knocking out a specific capability (“write in the style of
journalists”), organizers are able to get a good portion of people who
contribute content “close” to that capability involved (though some very
recent data-focused interpretability work
discussed below complicates this picture a bit). To use jargon for just
a sentence, it’ll probably be possible to conceptualize data strike
effectiveness in terms of how different groups achieve “coverage” of
regions of latent space.

A very exciting direction of technical research will involve figuring
out the best definition of closeness that is able to predict the
specific impacts of different bargaining outcome and collective action
campaigns on LLM capabilities.

Additionally, finding thresholds for similarity at which
this idea holds is an important area of future research: would a data
strike by Python coders be threatened if people who code in other
programming languages don’t join in? It seems possible! Similarly, are
there organizations or platforms with a lot of journalistic-esque
content that could threaten the leverage of the NYT data strike?

In short, if all major news organizations were to engage in a joint
data strike, I think we can be quite confident in predicting that
“post-strike” LLMs would exhibit qualitative and quantitative
differences in output. But if it’s just the New York Times alone, it’s
harder to say.

### Measuring a Data Strike’s
Impact

After a successful data strike (via legal action, or just via an
opt-out form), the NYT or the regulators might want to see if it was
really successful. They might try some tests along the lines of recent
research that’s looked
into propensity to complete copyrighted materials (see also evaluation
efforts like recent work from Liu et al, covered by Business
Insider).

However, as noted above, if ChatGPT still has access to tons of
articles from very similar publications, it might be the case that
auditors don’t see much evidence that ChatGPT’s capabilities
qualitatively changed.

What’s more, a model that has access to New York Times content but
has been specially tuned to not output this content verbatim might look
the “most innocent of all” in one of these audits. There are open
technical questions here that probably involve combining work on
memorization, machine unlearning and concept erasure.

Overall, from the perspective of an external auditor working with a
black box LLM, it will probably be hard to tell if a given
organization’s content was truly “wiped" from training data, and thus
also challenging to tell how much impact a data strike had on an LLM.
This is a critical concern for organizers of collective action. In the
EU, there are ongoing discussions about data
transparency laws that could seriously change the landscape here,
likely shifting power towards data creators

Of course, if a major LLM operator actually has to completely retrain
a model with no NYT content (which would have some serious logistical
concerns, discussed below), they’ll know the exact impact. We might also
ask whether AI operators themselves are able to preemptively estimate
the impact? There are actually two very recent lines of work that
suggest answering this question is indeed becoming more viable.

One approach might be to keep the LLM architecture the same, but use
a data valuation procedure to estimate "how big of a change would we see
if this training data were added or removed?" In fact, Anthropic has
published research presenting one method to do exactly
that.

It could make sense to actually partially train a fresh model without
a certain subset of data and compare performance directly – this is
generally what influence functions and other data valuation techniques
aim to approximate. The main argument against doing this is that it
would be very expensive. A pragmatic compromise that attempts to make
things a bit easier for AI operators might be setting standards about
regular intervals at which retraining happens (perhaps there’s a
speculative fiction piece to be written about the many implications of
“Retraining Day” as a new global holiday).

Another approach for estimating data value might be using the “SILO” architecture proposed
in recent research: create a pretraining set with only truly public
domain data and put potentially licensed and licensable content in a
siloed off “data store”.

This allowed the researchers who proposed this architecture to
directly test questions like “say we give the model access to six of the
Harry Potter books and ask it to generate the 7th; how does performance
compare when it has access to no Harry Potter books?” This architecture
is also able to directly attribute outputs to certain sentences in the
training data (e.g., quoting a passage from a Harry Potter book
directly).

### Connections
with Reddit’s Data Strike and the Moderation Strike at Stack
Exchange

The NYT is not alone in starting a data strike aimed specifically at
gaining leverage over LLM operators. Reddit recently announced a similar
initiative
(see this previous post).

Both of these organizations are profit-driven private firms. But
their content may have, at times, seemed like a commons. Some NYT
content is free to Internet users, and search engines, social media
sites, and chatbots generally benefit from access to NYT content
(because end-users ultimately want to consume this content). Similarly,
Reddit data has effectively acted as a commons for the purposes of AI research and other computational
social science.

Neither of these platforms ever operated a true commons, and were
always reliant on ad revenue to keep the servers running. But now it
seems the flashes of commons-esque access patterns may be disappearing.
We might characterize this as an enclosure of the
pseudo-commons. This is further complicated by the fact that the free
ChatGPT (and Claude, Bard, etc.) also have a pseudo-commons character.
If the NYT and Reddit are successful in harming LLM capabilities to gain
leverage, we may see short term “welfare drops” (to the extent one
believes LLMs do provide users utility).

It’s interesting to contrast this with a platform like Stack
Overflow. It seems like the platform that was more explicitly framed as
a commons has weathered things better so far: recent battles between
volunteer moderators and leadership have at least led to some degree of
collective
bargaining and iteration on AI-related policies. The data, which has
always been shared via Creative Commons (with some serious
contention
around slight changes to licensing), remains open for now.

On a platform like the NYT or Reddit, there’s some major variance in
how much each reader contributes to firm revenue. Lots of content on the
Internet pre-generative AI falls into an ambiguous space where in
practice, only some fraction of content consumers directly pay or
provide high value as an ad consumer. It seems that the generative AI
wave may ultimately lead to some reduction of this ambiguity, which
might in turn lead to less overall readership/consumption (but more
consumption that happens as part of an explicit economic
transaction).

### Conclusion

Ultimately, I am a big believer that supporting group-level data
agency will push the AI ecosystem away from harmful uses and towards
broadly shared benefits. In more words: in the very long run, one of the
most important things we can do to slowly steer AI operators into
building a multiplicity of AI systems that, together, embody a plurality
of human values (as opposed to embodying the values of a few powerful
people) held across the world is to make it easier for people to control
how their data contributions flow to AI systems. Importantly, I also
think data-related actions, especially opt-out actions should be
undertaken primarily at the group level and not the individual
level.

Thus, from a somewhat long-view, academic-hat perspective I think the
fact that organizations like the NYT and Reddit are “flexing their data
leverage muscles” is very important in principle, regardless of the
actual outcomes in the next 3-6 months (and even if it this the case
that LLMs continue to promote consumer welfare). I think that at some
point, it’s very important that some organization tests out the legal
and technical landscape here, even if in the long run the vast majority
of data-based collective bargaining relies mainly on the threat
of collective action. Data strikes in the wild will help us understand
the role of public opinion, how people perceive their role as
simultaneous users and creators of AI (see e.g. writing on heteromation,
prosumers, data
dignity).

From a practical perspective, I do think the NYT’s strike efficacy
(data leverage
power) could be inhibited by a lack of coalition building with other
news organizations (or even groups like academic professional
organizations). This may limit their leverage, and could make other
organizations more hesitant to try data strikes of their own. The fact
that other organizations are following suit with robots.txt is important
to note.

I am deeply excited about progress in data valuation and attribution.
I do think the fundamental challenges with external auditing may not be
getting enough attention, but am hoping that perhaps sharing valuation
and attribution as part of the collective bargaining process could be
viable in the long run. For instance, perhaps AI operators can be
incentivized to share influence estimates that capture the likely impact
of an NYT-strike or an all-news-orgs-strike as part of a bargaining
process. Here, some kind of public body for AI might play a key role as
a mediator of new kinds of generative AI-era bargaining agreements.

Finally, I do worry that a paradigm in which models are constantly
being destroyed and retrained on the basis of constant ongoing legal
battles will lead to a net negative effect on consumer welfare and stymy
potential gains in scientific progress that accompany generative AI.
There does seem to be a serious risk that public discussions on these
topics become even more polarized and miss out on the nuances in present
benefits and harms. But, I think finding a balance of opting out and in,
of contribution of strikes, of creation and destruction is totally
viable and will be to the net benefit of humanity.
