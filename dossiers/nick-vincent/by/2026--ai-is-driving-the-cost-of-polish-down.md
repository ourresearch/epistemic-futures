# AI is driving the cost of polish down; some musings on fancy versus terse artifacts

## Full text

In short: many have pointed out that AI progress is decreasing the
cost to “polish” or “embroider” all sorts of artifacts. This means that
communities that once used polish (broadly construed) as a cheap proxy
for community-specific measures of “real value” are being forced to
consider other signals of provenance and verifiability (or are simply
losing the ability to curate information). This is a problem that
communities and institutions face every time there’s new ways to get
“cheap polish”, but it’s especially bad right now. Even communities with
careful review processes to prevent “false positives” are affected.

This is a topic that’s already been discussed a lot!1 This post is an attempt to connect ongoing,
well-trodden discussions to ideas for improving curation and
introspecting, with a focus on peer review in particular. It’s also an
opportunity to highlight the data leverage angle. Threats to the
production of high quality information artifacts is also a problem for
the AI field itself; the communities and institutions that curate
knowledge are providing data for pre-training and for some kinds of post-training.
And the training of information producers like scientists is itself a
critical process for the eventual evaluation of AI systems. Finally, at
the end of the post, I’ll foreshadow another possible solution to this
problem: what if we go “full transparency” and just post the full
AI-interaction transcripts for any AI-touched artifacts we produce?

In the spirit of this post, here’s the bullets in case you want to
stop here:

-

(Recapping what others have said) AI progress is decoupling
presentation quality from underlying quality. This is breaking or will
break curation processes that relied on polish as a proxy signal
(including negative signals like "no polish = sloppy, and likely
‘bad’").

-

(Reiterating common advice) Iterating on our on work (sometimes
with AI, and oftentimes without) is useful for the sake of our own
thinking.

-

(Somewhat novel take) Even in cases in which people use AI
heavily (to e.g. produce dozens of complex analyses or visualizations
while iterating on a project), it may best for collective knowledge to
allow and incent people to ship dense/terse/focused artifacts (i.e., no
pressure to ship the AI-fancified version).

- We do this now in many small ways: the notion of an abstract, the
bulleted “contribution statement” at the end of Introduction, the fact
we sometimes restrict papers to 8 pages with many details thrown in
Appendices, etc. But we can do more!

-

One way to do this: we should endeavour to a small, carefully
chosen set of fancy artifacts, establish an expectation that fancy
artifacts also expose a simple view (the spreadsheet, the API, the raw
data) such that readers can add their own consumption layer if they
want, and also reward focused, not-fancy artifacts (e.g., focused
datasets, demos, methods code, etc.).

- Most importantly: we need to adjust credit allocation to create
induce a desirable distribution of fancy:simple artifacts

-

We can escape a particular “trap”, in which: human writes bullet
points → send to AI to generate long AI → send to colleague → AI takes
long prose and converts to bullets → human reads bullets.

-

(The data leverage angle) Dense-but-high-quality artifacts may
also be more useful as training data and more amenable to
retrieval.

### A new-ish problem

There’s a new emerging category of negative impact from AI progress
that you’ve likely seen or experienced firsthand. It looks like this: in
some community (or institution/organization), it used to be the case
certain dimensions of presentation quality were highly
correlated with the quality dimension that the community actually cares
about. This meant that presentation used to be a reasonable proxy for
quality, which was helpful when quality assessment needed for the
community to allocate attention and/or resources is expensive. The
problem that is arising (rapidly) is that AI progress makes it very easy
to produce artifacts where previously useful dimensions of presentation
quality become uncoupled from what the community really cares about.
This has the potential to temporarily “break” processes that curate and
allocate.

For instance, in academic peer review, having a uniquely well-crafted
figure early in a paper might make a reader/reviewer more likely to
believe the methods are reasonable. Of course, a diligent reviewer
should be wary of making of this assumption and still read the methods
carefully. It’s always been a challenge that reviewers judge books by
their covers, but generally there was some signal here. Someone choosing
whether to read an essay or blog might look for the presence of certain
linguistic markers early on. A standout personal website or CV might
catch the eye of recruiters or hiring managers, and a unique personal
project on GitHub might signal coding skills for somebody trying to
break into the industry.

Because it’s always been the case that people can “juice” the
presentation-related characteristics of an artifact without improving
the true quality, communities typically have some defences against over
relying on these proxies. For instance, a fancy figure alone is
not enough to cause a paper through most rigorous review
processes. But even when communities have strong defences against low
quality artifacts with very high polish, these communities often still
use “no polish at all” as an important negative signal.
Reviewers can use very poor presentation as a signal of overall
sloppiness; they see some bad signs early on and become more attuned to
other issues. throughout. This is important is the use of negative
signals also lowers the overall cost for a community to perform
curation. For more on the academic peer review context specifically, see
this recent recent work on “peer review death
spiral”

We might give this a wordy name: the “AI progress kills
certain-presentation-dimensions-as-quality-proxies” problem, or just
call it “decoupling of presentation and quality”.

### Is this problem going to get
worse?

As AI progress continues (I think it will), we should expect this
problem to get worse. It’s very easy to use frontier AI models to make a
beautiful and impressive figure that doesn’t mean anything. Writing
prose without AI smell remains challenging (but I believe this will
absolutely be solved in time with need tighter feedback loops to get the
data; I actually think cross-platform posting will be a big unlock here,
e.g. people on Twitter making fun of AI slop on LinkedIn, etc.).

Given this problem, we now face a number of new challenging
questions: how should communities change our expectations around
presentation, how should curation processes adjust, and how should
individuals make choice about effort allocation?

Importantly, for researchers trying to choose how we spend our
limited time, we must answers: Should I spend 10 hours agentically
vibe-coding 50 different visualizations? Should I spent 10 minutes and
just take the very first output from the agent? Shoud I make a
matplotlib default bar plot and let my reader code up their own
personalized viewer?

### We should still
make our artifacts look nice

Before we proceed, I should make it very clear that I
definitely do think we should still try to make our artifacts look
nice; we should create clear and insightful figures for our
papers, make our websites interesting and useful, etc.

I also believe deeply in the value of iterating on writing and other
research outputs in order to improve one’s own clarity of thinking and
thereby improve future versions of the topic. Re-writing can improve
your thinking; marinating on your figures may cause you to rethink your
interpretation; soaking in your data may cause you to identify new
connections between ideas or interpretations of a past finding, and so
on. I’ve rewritten parts of this blog post several times; sat on it,
came back to it, etc. I’m definitely not saying we should only be
shipping raw bullet points and early data2.

So regardless of the impact on community curation, iterating on
writing and visualization is important just to improve research
outcomes.

### Choosing to ship simpler
artifacts

With all that said, I am hopeful that in some cases, AI’s ability to
make beautiful figures can free us from the need to make beautiful
figures. We’ll still have a few very fancy artifacts, but in
many cases we can ship terse but dense blogs, bullets, and data
files.

One response to the above is that AI progress can just raise the
floor for presentation quality. Because we can employ swarms of frontier
AI agents to make a truly top tier website, every academic should be
using modern web technologies to create a bespoke search and filtering
system over their own papers. For every paper we release, we should
create a dedicated static site with a fully interactive explorer (I do
think the potential for multiverse analysis is in many ways
exciting).

However, I think we should not set a new expectation that we have
maximally fancy views over all our artifacts. Even as AI gets better,
this has an opportunity cost. (Time spent iterating on figures is time
not spent collecting new data, for instance).

Furthermore, (I think) there is a lot of charm — and legitimate value
— in the “classic CS professor website” experience. Typically this
experience is characterized by plain HTML, bulleted lists, and a focus
on getting right to the content: “Here’s my list of publications” or
“here’s the top three things I’ve been thinking about lately”.

Most importantly, if we ship more “stripped down” objects,
this may in some cases impose less overall review costs on the
community/ecosystem.

I’m hopeful that instead of starting a race to deploy a full web app
for every paper and blog post, we can instead do the following: deploy
AI-enhanced applications that use modern web technologies for
certain select artifacts, but actually err more on the side of
the “CS professor website philosophy” for most artifacts, with
the consideration in mind that our reader can use the same tools that we
have access to to add polish as necessary. If you hate the default
styles for HTML papers on arxiv, there’s never been a better time to
code your own arxiv-reader!

In other words, I’m starting to feel more inclined to try to create a
larger number of simple blogs, notes, and spreadsheets (but still make
sure these are good and thoughtful) and a smaller number of fancy
artifacts. And even for fancy artifacts, I want to make the “simple
view” very prominent. For instance, for apps that are really a fancy
view over some spreadsheet, be sure to just show people the spreadsheet
view and let them apply styles to your spreadsheet if they want to.

### Sometimes,
the people want simple bullet points; let’s cut to the chase

You may have also seen this marketoonist
comic3 or variations of the joke contained
within:

From Tom Fishburne. Licensing info here.

This comic is funny and points to a real problem: obviously, if
everyone is going through this process for all their emails, this may
just create a new source of miscommunication and it’s certainly wasting
both electricity and human energy.

But it also suggests the potential for a good-for-all-parties
improvement (a “strong Pareto improvement”) in communication: if both
parties in this kind of exchange identify what is happening, they can
just go back to sharing the bullets! I think most people will also agree
that this is how communication in many of their best working
relationships functions — people just send each other quick, information
dense messages.

One promising direction to solve this problem is by building social
technologies that surface unstated, shared preferences, i.e. breaking
through the norms that cause people to act out the cartoon above instead
of just sending the bullet points that the both sides prefer.

### Reflecting on some recent
projects

In December 2025, I had a resurgence in motivation making all sorts
of fancy static sites for sharing scholarly work, ideas, promoting AI
and data literacy, etc. “Now that I have coding agents”, I thought, “I
can clear my backlog”. (See e.g. datacounterfactuals.org,
datalicenses.org, exploringai.org).

I remain very excited about the ideas. But I’m also becoming more
convinced that for many data-related projects, the most important parts
are selecting and designing schema, maintaining raw data, and maybe
providing one or two opinionated UX flow over that data. Increasingly,
people can just insert their own consumption layer and analysis. So for
these kinds of projects, I think it’s important that any fancy websites
also expose a simpler “spreadsheets” view or “API view”.

We should still be thinking deeply about our core claim/data/etc. And
to do so, that might mean we build a local fancy interface over our
data, run multiverse, etc. But the artifact we broadcast more widely
should oftentimes just be the bullet points. All the time we spent
iterating on different analyses and increasingly complex views over the
data served, most importantly, to improve the final “terse
contribution”. In many scholarly communities, writing norms handle this
already: you have a “contribution paragraph” at the en of your
Introduction with 2-4 bullet points. And there are incentives to write
tweet threads, news briefs, etc. for your papers.

Applied at scale this approach can help us solve a number of more
foundational communication-related social dilemmas: we feel compelled to
expend effort on presentation efforts that we don’t even think our
intended recipient cares about; we’re expending this effort purely
because we’re trapped in a collective action problem.

Ideally, we should try to set up our new institutional rules and
norms such that individual contributors can iterate on
presentation-related variables up to point the stops being useful
for them and stop there; any reader can continue iterating to their
heart’s desire.

### Crediting
people for more focused contributions

If more communities agree that sometimes, just providing a more “raw”
contribution (with appropriate guarantees of validity) can be useful,
this may open the door for systems that credit more focused
contributions. In the realm of science, there’s an argument for more
cleanly separating review of the actual data from the surrounding paper
and discussion (normally, these do map to different sections in the peer
reviewer “rubric”). In the realm of semi-speculative blogging, we might
separate the current events commentary from the thought experiments.

I think various academic communities might benefit from more venues
that accept focused contributions (e.g., datasets only, methods code
only) without forcing authors to jump through additional hoops just to
make their data contribution look like another type of paper or
artifact. In the context of HCI and design, there’s a lot of value in
giving people credit for just creating new demos without requiring every
project to be a groundbreaking contribution to the literature. Of
course, individuals will stand to benefit from making some contributions
that are durable, but it should be more acceptable to have e.g. a
durable contribution followed be a related, supporting set of smaller
demos and validations.

Any changes along these lines could also support proposals to improve
the evaluation of scientific careers by focusing much more on quality
over quantity, e.g. by having hiring process or review processes that
focus more on “tell me about your 1-2 most important papers”.

### Some implications for data
quality

One interesting consideration is that focused bullet points in
markdown combined with raw data and clean, terse code could be more
useful as AI training data than PDF files, but will almost certainly be
more amenable to retrieval by AI systems. Simple artifacts could, in
many cases, be easy to add or infer structured metadata. And very
importantly, increasing the number of people that deeply engage with the
artifacts actually enables more effective collaborative filtering.

This topic deserves longer treatment (full empirical study, ideally!)
but I’m decently confident about the general idea.

Another idea to throw into the mix: one way to reduce doubts about
whether AI polished an artifact without improving it’s quality would be
to share the actual AI transcripts. This might enable readers to assess
the quality of AI intervention (did you ask the right prompts? Which
parts of the code were “one shot” and which parts were iterated upon?).
This is, in some sense, a very natural extension totally open science to
the AI agent era. It also has massive implications for privacy,
reputation, and trust. And would impact the supply of training/eval data
for future models. Also, worthy of much more thought!

the metascience dream (or nightmare) with AI for science”, OpenAIReview’s
introductory blog post, and/or this tweet

These caveats feels especially important, as I’ve been teaching a
graduate research communication course this term, and thus have been
earnestly discussing these topics with students, and trying to come up
with good answers for how standards and best practices will change.

in the era of generative ai, someone writes 3 bullets as a prompt, ai
makes a flowery email, and then the recipient uses ai to condense back
to 3 bullets?”)
