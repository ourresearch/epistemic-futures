# Evaluation Data Leverage: Advances like "Deep Research" Highlight a Looming Opportunity for Bargaining Power

## Full text

This post has two related goals:

-

Motivate the idea of “Evaluation Data Leverage”: knowledge
workers will be able to bargain with AI operators for access to their
data-generating activities that are specifically needed to evaluate new
AI models and products.

-

Highlight the challenge that more “general” AI products require
evaluation practices that will be very laborious for workers and have a
large overall price tag. This could very well create major optics issues
for the AI and tech industry if these organizations become widely
regarded as agents of precarity.

An ad for evaluation labour from 1894 (Wikimedia
Commons).

Time marches on, and tech companies continue to ship products that
use large-scale models to do some combination of augmenting and/or
automating knowledge work. Increasingly, across various firms, two
trends emerging are the use of “reasoning” and the implementation of
“deep research agents”.

Together, these developments mean that AI products continue to
produce larger and potentially more complex artifacts. For instance, a
good deal of ink has been spilled over the value of Deep Research. Will
(AI) research agents replace (human) research assistants? Are you
getting equivalent value to eight hours of human knowledge work in 10
minutes? Are your outputs full of hard-to-catch hallucinations? Will
these agents lead to a slew of epistemically toxic artifacts strewn
across the web (and in the case of Google’s Deep Research, which makes
you read the output in Google Docs, your personal Drive).

This short Tyler Cowen blog post
nicely captures both the positive view (in the content) and the negative
view (in the comments and responses). As another example, consider this
commentary piece in Science
from Derek Lowe.

Well, to know that for sure whether we can get 8 hours of human
knowledge work in 10 minutes, we’d probably want to do a very thorough
comparison.

### Evaluating Deep
Research: What We Have So Far

Here is OpenAI’s Deep Research release.
Three benchmarks are mentioned: HLE, GAIA, and “internal evaluation of
expert-level tasks”. We get three examples, which are claimed to have
saved 4, 5, and 2 hours. Presumably these used some binary pass/fail
rating scheme (we see a “Pass Rate” mentioned): the experts “approved”
the answers. It’s unclear if the experts estimated the time needed, or
if they actually worked until they reached some quality threshold
(determined by other experts?) and then paused their stopwatch. We’ll
get more info down the line: “We will share our safety insights and
safeguards for deep research in a system card when we widen access to
Plus users.”

Why harp on this? Evaluating “deep research” across past and future
areas of human inquiry will take immense manual labour.

### What
could a very thorough evaluation process look like?

Well, we’d probably want to start by getting a group of white-collar
workers to agree to sign on to produce points of comparison. Ideally (in
terms of richness of data — especially if we want to compare the process
used, the intermediate states of the output artifacts, etc.), they’d
agree to be monitored — perhaps via a webcam and/or screen capture.
Getting very fine-grained data would involve surveillance technology
similar to that used to monitor students taking remote exams during
COVID. Generally, this kind of software can be
distressing
to use. Of course, in the context of working as a distinguished data
evaluator in the service of humanity, perhaps people would be fine with
it.

It seems likely this kind of surveilled-knowledge-work-data-labor has
happened quite a bit already, and will happen even more. At first it
will be kept secret, but as the total volume of
surveilled-knowledge-work-data-labor increases, it will be hard to keep
it completely hidden. I think the optics of this shift are going to be
very bad, because some of this evaluation work will be ramping up in
conjunction with disruptive job market impacts. That is, people will
viscerally see movement towards a more precarious overall economy for
most workers. The AI industry may start to hold blame in the eyes of the
public for a rollback in cushiness of (some) knowledge work.

Perhaps this whole surveillance process is overkill. Could we build a
pretty decent evaluation set just by asking people to send in their
“human deep research report” and self-reported data about time use? In
practice, many timesheet-based knowledge workers do this and it works
fine. And, this is what many existing benchmarks already look like, and
may be what the evals mentioned in the Deep Research release post look
like as well.

However, I actually think the surveillance approach will be
necessary, and here’s why: LLMs have already become embedded in
knowledge work. They’re being used in crowdwork, and there’s increasing
consensus that for some types of assignments they have effectively
trivialized unsupervised homework.

It’s going to be very important to have relatively “pure” evals for
those evals to mean anything (I personally think this feedback loop is
even more concerning than “model collapse” — more on this in another
post).

### One quick bout of napkin
math

To illustrate the idea that evaluation labor is going to take a lot
of human-hours, we might run through one quick bout of napkin math.
Looking at the three examples provided by OpenAI, we might assume that
one Deep Research query is “valued” at 5 hours of time (and that more
complex queries take more time to compare).

Let’s value our expert billing rate at $200/hr (of course, successful
coordination by AI operators could drive this down; successful
coordination by data intermediaries could drive it up).

So, using English Wikipedia as a proxy (with numerous caveats) for
how many “articles” make up human knowledge, let’s say we want to
produce a deep research-level report for 1/10 of Wikipedia’s almost 7M
articles (~700k reports, 5 hours per question, $200/hr): this will
require 700M of labor costs (small beans compared to 11 trillion needed to
commission a brand new LLM dataset from scratch). But if we then want to
double check our work (get 2 people per report), we’re paying 1.4B. If
we want to robustly measure variances and inter-rater reliability, we
might be looking at tens of billions — that could eat an entire
fundraising round for an AI start-up!

And critically, for any domain in which the relevant experts are able
to organize, they could bargain around this evaluation
contract. Knowledge workers in a given domain could easily make
it functionally impossible to measure how well AI is doing in that
domain.

### Evaluation data leverage

Right now, a variety of tools exist, and there are very heterogeneous
perspectives on their usefulness. You can find strong examples showing
apparent utility alongside very strong examples of negative utility.
There’s certainly some motivated reasoning going on here on both sides,
and there’s plenty of precedent for public opinion being split on new
technology.

But this situation is somewhat unique, because the explicit goal of
extreme generality makes the evaluation of “AI” a very collective human
task. Compare this to evaluating vacuum cleaners — a relatively small
set of people can cover all the edge cases for a vacuum cleaner. But for
a research agent, we ideally want to model, well, everybody who does
research. And if this agent is supposed to be used by consumers, we also
want to model… every consumer.

I’ve long argued for a “We all helped achieve this” framing for
discussing the production of LLMs (with the caveat that of course, the
distribution of credit is not literally uniform). And almost by
definition, serious evaluation of general AI will require similar, if
not greater, large-scale coordination.

We will still have leverage through our training data, though the
magnitude of this leverage is highly contingent on pending legal
decisions, regulatory action (or lack thereof), and answering technical
questions about data protection technology. Organizing collective action
when your estimated leverage is very volatile is a scary prospect and
not useful for movement building.

This means that if I had to pick the most “stable” form of data
leverage right, it would be data action specifically aimed at the
evaluation side of things.

Putting things another way, if I could give advice to a billionaire
interested in AI safety who was open to a “data leverage” approach, it
would be to directly fund organizing efforts for existing data workers
and to begin raising awareness about evaluation leverage for general
knowledge workers.

### Will Evaluation
Leverage Actually Happen?

I believe there is a high probability that evaluation data leverage
will become significant—and in some cases, it may already be taking
shape. In particular, I expect evaluation data leverage to be especially
useful for, and used by, organizations that represent professionalized
labour, e.g. medicine and law.

On the other hand, an area where evaluation data leverage will face
serious challenges is in the general white-collar workplace. These
contexts rarely have collective bargaining for employees and employees
typically have no rights over the intellectual property they produce or
other outputs. In large firms, I expect employers to add more draconian
surveillance-style data collection that converts existing knowledge work
into AI eval work (in fact, some firms may have already run their own
bespoke evals of Deep Research because they actually have detailed logs
of employees producing similar outputs). In other words, white-collar
workers will probably get a new set of tasks — moonlighting as AI
evaluators.

### Fitting this into past
frameworks

In the original data leverage framework paper, we primarily compare
and contrast different types of actions: data strikes, data poisoning,
and leverage through conscious data contribution. In a follow-up paper, we taxonomized data
labor, with a focus on six particular dimensions: for a given
data-generating activity that produces some valuable record: (1) is the
data labor legible to the creator, (2) is the creator aware of the
end-use for that data, (3) does the creator collaborate with others to
produce the data, (4) is the data eventually made “open”, (5) how
“replaceable” (vs specialized) in the activity, and (6) is the
data-generating activity part of the creator’s set of “livelihood
generating activities” (i.e., are they doing this as part of their
job?)

### What Makes Eval Data Eval
Data?

Of course, it’s interesting to note that there’s nothing that makes
eval data special other than the fact that the data is used for
evaluation. In fact, the more special handling applied to the production
of eval data, the less useful it is, because we typically want to know
performance for our “true” distribution (or as close as we can get).

In other words, we can’t actually look at a document and say whether
it’s “eval” or “training”. This means for a data laborer, access
to “evaluation-specific leverage” is about end
use-awareness.

Critically, this means eval leverage waxes and wanes. Immediately
after the release of deep research agents (which are perhaps being
pushed out more quickly than planned due to market race dynamics) is the
full moon for eval leverage in this context.

These contexts rarely have collective bargaining for employees and employees typically have no rights over the intellectual property they produce or other outputs. In large firms, I expect employers to add more draconian surveillance-style data collection that converts existing knowledge work into AI eval work (in fact, some firms may have already run their own bespoke evals of Deep Research because they actually have detailed logs of employees producing similar outputs). In other words, white-collar workers will probably get a new set of tasks — moonlighting as AI evaluators."
