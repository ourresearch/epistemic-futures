# Bing Rewards for the AI Age

In this post, I’ll propose an approach for addressing three distinct
concerns facing the actors responsible for generative AI systems: the
computational costs facing AI operators, the concern that Generative AI
systems may erode their own foundations by reducing traffic to platforms
where training data is created, and the lack of credit given to
individual users and communities for their data contributions. Our
proposal is to give people credits, akin to the Bing search engine’s
“Rewards”, for their past and future data contributions, which can be
used to query expensive AI systems. All users would receive some
replenishing supply of credits, in accordance with the collective nature
of the vast data underlying AI, with additional credit given to notable
data contributions. This approach can simultaneously address the
incentives faced by AI-operating firms, online platforms, and individual
users. We discuss the potential for a relatively lightweight system –
that is quite similar to existing features of Bing, Dall·E 2, and cloud
computing – to enable inclusive governance of AI systems.

### Introduction

Generative AI (GAI) systems like ChatGPT and now Bing Chat continue
to dominate public discourse around computing and tech more generally.
Not only do firms need to contend with the increased costs of new GAI
systems, but Microsoft has decided
to shorten the maximum conversation length with Bing Chat as a quick way
to constrain the outputs. At the same, concerns around the “paradox
of reuse” remain relevant: large-language models (LLMs) and other
systems use data from platforms like Wikipedia, Reddit, and
StackExchange to fuel their impressive capabilities, but may reduce
traffic to these very platforms and cut off contributions. Finally,
there is an open debate about whether data creators are being fairly
compensated for their role in fueling generative AI. All three of these
issues are high-stakes, and failing to address any individual issue
could cause serious sustainability issues for the new AI ecosystem.

In this post, we lay out a hopeful vision of a “three-for-one”
strategy for developing a credit economy for LLMs, that responds to
incentives facing different actors in the AI ecosystems: the firms that
operate generative AI systems (e.g. OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Stability
AI), the platforms that host particularly important training data (e.g.
Wikipedia, GitHub, StackExchange), and the individual users who generate
training data (e.g. artists, writers, coders, and even everyday web
surfers).

First, firms want to maximize the ratio of revenue to query cost (to
make more money). That is, they want to avoid running expensive
inference operations if that computation won’t lead to ad revenue, user
retention, and/or sales. Similarly, at a societal level we all share an
interest in maximizing the ratio of information to query cost: everybody
benefits from information retrieval systems with better signal to noise
ratios (which can be improved by improving the system, or teaching
people how to use the system).

LLMs have higher compute costs than traditional search engines, so
firms face a general incentive to limit how often LLMs are queried.
While the primary incentive here is about firm revenue, there are also
several other minor reasons to limit LLMs queries. It seems limiting
conversation length is one way
to constrain LLM outputs. Additionally, firms have made some efforts to
address ecological impacts of computing (e.g., reducing carbon costs),
but there is a societal interest in avoiding “excessive” energy
consumption.

Second, the platforms like Wikipedia, StackExchange, and GitHub that
facilitate the creation of valuable knowledge artifacts and the broad
sharing of knowledge via permissive licensing regimes need web traffic
to attract new contributors, editors, and moderators. Ultimately, they
need users and either revenue and donations. If LLMs cut off the flow of
traffic to these platforms, the platforms could be severely negatively
impacted (the “paradox
of re-use”). Indeed, reductions in GitHub contributions or Wikipedia
edits can be seen as LLMs eroding their own foundations, taking away
opportunities to create training data needed to advance LLM capabilities
further.

These platforms could benefit if Bing or Google send new traffic
their way (“Hey, we noticed you like getting answers from ChatGPT… did
you know you can make ChatGPT 2.0 even better by helping out on
Wikipedia or StackExchange?”). Indeed, Wikipedia is so often a key source for
answering search queries that it may be optimal for all parties to send
searchers straight to the Wikipedia platform. To work towards this kind
of outcome, it may be helpful to collect more feedback from community
leaders, which a credit system could facilitate.

Third, individuals want more agency over the data they produce. We
can assume that in general, if individuals have the option to receive
direct compensation, or increased recognition, for contributions to AI,
they would take that option. Making that credit tangible can be a
stepping stone towards a better paradigm for allocating both credit and
reward. The public is largely responsible
for the success of LLMs, in a counterfactual sense -- without
contributions to pre-training data like Wikipedia articles, GitHub
commits, arXiv papers, blog posts, tweets, and more, LLM capabilities
would be meaningfully impacted. With collective action, a united front
of individual coders, writers, or artists could boost up or tear down
generative AI capabilities.

As we will illustrate below, a sort of “mini-economy” for LLM use is
actually very practical. Precedents exist in systems like Microsoft Rewards,
existing generative AI systems, and cloud compute credits.
We also have a wide variety of examples to draw on from crowdsourcing
and human computation literature to mini-economies in online virtual
worlds like MMOs.

In short, there may be an opportunity to solve several
incentive-related challenges at once!

### The Proposal

Firms are starting to paywall and rate-limit
access to GAI. OpenAI sells API calls to its models, and now has a
ChatGPT “pro subscription”. The Bing Chat beta, though still free, now
has limits on how many queries a user can submit.

We can imagine an LLM system like Bing Chat that requires users to
spend credits to query the LLM directly, and that provides fallbacks
like traditional search or platform-situated search engines (like using
DuckDuckGo’s “bangs” to
search Wikipedia directly). The building blocks for this idea are
already ubiquitous: buying and issuing credits
is a common practice for cloud computing platforms like Azure and as
noted above, the Bing rewards program (technically, "Microsoft Rewards")
provides much of the scaffolding needed for LLM credits. Given Bing’s issues
with longer conversations, the credit cost could even scale with session
length (rather than capping at 5, double the credit cost after 5
messages in a single session). This issue may also be solved in the
future, at which point the pricing scheme can simply be updated.

Users would receive a replenishing supply of credits simply for
having an account. This would be justified for two reasons. First, it
follows the basic logic that any Google or Bing user can access search
results for free because they consume ads while they search. Presumably,
Google, Bing, and firms operating similar technologies want people to
use these systems and to remain within their respective ecosystems
(e.g., to use Chrome and Google Docs or Edge and Microsoft Word,
respectively). However, the replenishing supply of credits could also be
justified on the basis that any user of a computing system has played,
and will continue to play, a role in collectively producing the massive
sea of training data that fuels systems like LLMs. We’ll likely never
pinpoint people’s individual roles in creating training data with true
granularity, so it makes sense to just give some credit to everyone.

Notable data contributions could provide a path to earn additional
credit. Most simply, when users actively give feedback on model results
(i.e., perform the same kind of labor as contractors hired by OpenAI to
build ChatGPT), they should receive credits. This would happen at
recurring intervals, so users could be motivated by their interest in
LLM usage to join GitHub or Wikipedia and make contributions that are
accepted. Of course, the users would still need to follow community
norms to become active users, but we could imagine the paradox of reuse
being entirely reversed in the best case scenario.

Credit could also be allocated for historical contributions to
training data, along the lines of a “data dividend” (as opposed
to a data market). If users link their LLM accounts to data creation
platforms like GitHub, they could earn additional credits. It’s very
difficult to tease out the impact of individual GitHub contributors,
StackOverflow users, or Wikipedia editors on LLM capabilities, so the
best first pass version of this system would involve giving a small
amount of credits to anyone who participates in any of these
communities. There’s precedent here: GitHub is giving free access to
Co-pilot for open source maintainers.

Down the line, if firms do want to perform data valuation and try to
estimate the relative impact of different communities on LLM
capabilities, it could make sense to allocate credits at the community
level and let that community govern how the credits are allocated. So if
GitHub users decide they do want to give extra credits to especially
prodigious OSS contributors, they can do so. If LLMs continue to scale
in capabilities and these credits become more powerful, this could chart
a pathway towards sustainability funding OSS development (though we will
discuss below that a weakness of this overall strategy is that it’s
unlikely to provide a large number of well compensated jobs on its
own).

Of course, users who find this whole system excessively complex could
just pay a subscription fee or buy credits directly (or continue to use
search as it exists now).

### How this Plays Out

To illustrate how this system addresses the incentives described
above, we’ll describe a few very short scenarios.

For a user with relatively encyclopedic queries (“george washington
biographical facts”, “history of singapore”, “who invented coffee”),
they might choose to search Wikipedia directly instead of interfacing
with the web exclusively through LLMs. This will lead to said user
visiting Wikipedia directly. We’d also expect the compute burden of the
LLM ecosystem (including carbon cost and demand on compute resources
that could be used for other research areas) to fall a bit. Ideally,
this might complement something like a carbon
dividend.

For AI operators looking to collect targeted training data, they can
do so in a fair and transparent manner. Users will know exactly how much
credit they’ll earn and what that will get them, so labor market
dynamics can emerge. Of course, new questions will arise regarding the
fairness of this new AI credit economy.

For individuals interested in seeing historical training data
acknowledged, the credits system can greatly elevate the visibility of
large collective efforts like Wikipedia editing and contributing to OSS
in fueling LLMs. It can also increase the “prestige” associated with
doing things like provide human feedback for future AI systems. This
acknowledgment alone may be pivotal in scaffolding collective action,
using regulatory levers, or using data itself as a lever.

### Downsides

One primary concern that would likely arise with this system is that
it adds additional layers of financialization to information retrieval
and generative systems that currently sort of look like public goods. Of
course, these systems have never been true public
goods,
and we’re seeing that the bricks are already being laid to paywall LLM
access. Arguably, the best hope for more public goods-esque LLMs is to
create a nationalized competitor (along the lines of a nationalized
search engine), which this credit approach could actually support.
Of course, this idea has never been proven, and so remains speculative
(and is not core to this proposal). While financialization may feel bad
for users, it could also represent an improvement over information
retrieval systems that are opaquely reliant on targeted advertising.

While credit-gating LLM queries could create inequities in access to
knowledge (by e.g. imposing more search time costs on people who don’t
have as many credits or means to pay subscription fees), we assume that
existing search engines would continue to operate (and research would
continue to improve them). Furthermore, individual platforms can still
support search and recommendation; presumably Wikipedia’s native search
engine will provide a baseline for equitable knowledge access, given
Wikipedia’s unique incentives.

Another concern is that this system could be seen as indirectly
putting a price tag on Wikipedia edits or StackOverflow answers. This is
best addressed by handling individual credits and community credits
separately. When an individual provides direct feedback, they earn
direct credit. While contributing to any of the platforms that are major
data sources can earn individuals additional credit, credits should be
allocated to Wikipedia itself or to GitHub itself, and then governed in
a hierarchical fashion (so GitHub users might decide to pay prominent
contributors directly, whereas Wikipedia might exchange credits for
hosting costs or to support new AI technologies that improve Wikipedia
directly). One particularly promising way to extend the credit system
could be to give online communities the ability to spend their
communally held credits on votes. Thus, by allocating credits
to Wikipedia (or to a community of educators, or artists, etc.), the
community could spend those credits to vote on how they’d like
generative AI systems to be governed or constrained.

Another major concern we foresee is that the program could be seen as
giving out pittances. The closest real-world analogue is Microsoft
Rewards, a program that gives users a $5 gift card for 380-1520 web
queries (i.e., nothing close to a true “wage” in any context).
Certainly, while we laid out many challenges that this approach could
solve, in the short term it is probably not going to
meaningfully impact economic inequality measures nor drastically
increase the number of people on Earth earning a living wage. If people
can exchange credits for cash, perhaps some people could add an
additional income stream akin to crowdwork (which is itself commonly
problematic in terms of wages and working
conditions). Ultimately, this kind of approach must be implemented
alongside ambitious state action to tackle poverty and drive economic
growth.

### Who
Would Be Responsible for Implementing This Credit System?

The easiest approach would be for firms themselves to implement this
kind of system. As noted above, many firms and organizations are
probably already halfway there (or more).

We can compare this idea with existing Microsoft
Rewards:

-

people earn points that can be converted to cash value (gift
cards)

-

points can be donated to a joint cause

-

The actual “conversion rate”:

-

5-20 points per search

-

7600 points = $5 gift card (1000 points = about 66 cents). The
exact rate varies by gift card.

However, another option could be to scaffold this system via
data-focused industrial policy. If a governmental body were to institute
some kind of “Data Relations Board” (see e.g. this proposal
for a Data Relations Board in California), this board could set
standards for credit allocation. In fact, the easiest way for a state
entity to set standards in the space would be for that entity to operate
their own “nationalized” LLM, akin to a state-affiliated supermarket
cooperative that competes on prices. Then, the Data Relations Board can
set standards for labor practices in this space. Ideally, this could
allow for a high-level of data sharing and rapid innovation, instead of
a paradigm in which individual organizations are incentivized to “hide
away” data that could be support the public interest.

### Implementing in Stages

The LLM credit system could be implemented in stages, with the early
stage version being developed very rapidly. We’ll use Microsoft and Bing
chat as a running example, but these stages are applicable to any LLM
operator.

A very simple alpha version could involve just two components:
issuing every Microsoft account 100 credits a month and providing
additional credits for each “feedback submission” (with some basic spam
filtering).

The second stage would involve adding a system that allows users to
link their Microsoft account to a GitHub, StackOverflow, Wikipedia
account to earn an additional “contributor stipend”. This would require
defining a criteria for being an “Active Participant” on each platform,
again to dis-incentivize spam. Ideally, this should involve deep
collaboration with the platforms to make sure the new system drives
primarily good faith engagement on the platform and avoids at all costs
any incentive to spam Wikipedia with low quality edits or game GitHub
contribution metrics. This will be an ongoing challenge, but critically
the baseline to beat here is not starving the platforms of
traffic.

The third stage would involve performing collective data valuation,
i.e. allocating a large number of credits to GitHub, StackOverflow, and
Wikipedia, to let the contributors of those platforms allocate and
govern how the credits are used.

The fourth stage would involve allowing communities to exchange
credits for some kind of governance power, rather than just using the
credits to pay for queries (or to convert to gift cards).

### A Worked "Back of the
Napkin” Example

Finally, we will work through a “back of the napkin” example with
real numbers to show how this system might work.

Let’s consider Bob the Bing user. Bob receives 100 credits at the
start of the month, and the cost to query Bing Chat is one credit. These
credits are valued at about 1 cent. Let’s assume there are still
concerns with long conversations, so the cost doubles after five queries
in a session.

Bob can provide feedback on a query to earn a credit. This feedback
undergoes some kind of spam detection, and not all queries allow for
feedback. Let’s assume it takes about 5 minutes to provide a good
feedback record, so Bob can earn 1000 credits for providing 12 pieces of
feedback (i.e., a rate of $10 per hour). By consistently providing
feedback, a user can build a reputation and greatly increase the credits
they earn, similar to the vision laid out by Kittur et al. As Bob
builds a reputation for providing good faith feedback, the rate
increases, but presumably the amount of feedback needed will drop so
eventually we’d expect Bob to spend much less time providing feedback
but earn many more credits. Some users might spend 5 minutes a week so
they can have an extra 100 queries, others might spend an hour or two
per week to cash out for an extra $520 - $1040 a year.

Bob links his GitHub account (he shares some small Python side
projects, and reports issues in major scientific software repositories).
His account meets an “active user criteria”, so he earns an extra 50
credits per month. Bob does not directly earn credits for
gameable metrics like number of individual commits. This system is still
somewhat gameable, as people may try to do the bare minimum activity to
meet the criteria, but presumably some fraction of users who make a
GitHub account and try to do some basic level of commits will actually
become real contributors; same with Wikipedia, StackExchange, etc. In
other words, with a well-designed activity criteria, even people trying
to game the system will end up contributing to these systems (and of
course, sometimes the most impactful thing will be to get one new power
user to join the platform, rather than getting 100 users who make just a
single contribution). Furthermore, the credits from historical
contributions will be much lower than credits from providing active
feedback, so those who want to earn credits have a path of least
resistance: they’ll provide active feedback directly to the AI operator
rather than trying to “game” GitHub.

At the end of the month, Microsoft makes a broad estimate of the
impact of GitHub data on new capabilities. GitHub itself offers a voting
platform (perhaps similar to, or using, something like PolicyKit), and Bob participates in
voting on how the credits (some converted into cash), are distributed
(or down the line, if the credits should be used to vote directly on how
generative AI systems should be deployed).

As Bob builds a reputation for providing good faith feedback, the rate increases, but presumably the amount of feedback needed will drop so eventually we’d expect Bob to spend much less time providing feedback but earn many more credits. Some users might spend 5 minutes a week so they can have an extra 100 queries, others might spend an hour or two per week to cash out for an extra $520 - $1040 a year."

"plaintext": "Bob links his GitHub account (he shares some small Python side projects, and reports issues in major scientific software repositories). His account meets an “active user criteria”, so he earns an extra 50 credits per month. Bob does not directly earn credits for gameable metrics like number of individual commits. This system is still somewhat gameable, as people may try to do the bare minimum activity to meet the criteria, but presumably some fraction of users who make a GitHub account and try to do some basic level of commits will actually become real contributors; same with Wikipedia, StackExchange, etc. In other words, with a well-designed activity criteria, even people trying to game the system will end up contributing to these systems (and of course, sometimes the most impactful thing will be to get one new power user to join the platform, rather than getting 100 users who make just a single contribution). Furthermore, the credits from historical contributions will be much lower than credits from providing active feedback, so those who want to earn credits have a path of least resistance: they’ll provide active feedback directly to the AI operator rather than trying to “game” GitHub."
