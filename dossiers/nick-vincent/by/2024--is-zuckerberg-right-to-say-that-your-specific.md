# Is Zuckerberg right to say that your specific creative work has no value to AI?

## Full text

The Verge recently published an interview
with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. This article leads with a potentially
provocative claim: both individual creators (e.g., a blogger or
YouTuber) and publishers (e.g., a news outlet) “tend to overestimate the
value of their specific content”. Zuckerberg goes on to say that if
individuals or organizations opt out from training, Meta might choose to
simply ignore their data with minimal loss of AI performance. This
stance echoes how Meta has treated news organizations making demands of
Meta in Canada and Australia (i.e., just implementing
a news ban).

Is this claim true?

First of all, there’s a falsifiable technical claim here about the
average leave-one-out influence of any individual or group on important
benchmark scores. In other words, we could try to answer the implied
question here — “What is the exact impact of your content or
your publisher’s content on an AI model” — by setting up
experiments to answer questions such as, “If we train a model without
your content, what questions does the new AI system get wrong, what
facts does it forget, and what new errors does it make?”

Of course retraining an entire model just to check the value of one
individual’s content might seem excessive, but that’s where the still
growing field of training
data influence estimation and data attribution comes
in. Major players like Anthropic are working on enhancing these techniques;
this line of work may very well carry over to data bargaining.

So, if we interpret the claim that the"individual work of most
creators isn’t valuable enough for it to matter" as, “the average
influence — whether an estimated “leave-one-out score” or related
definition of influence — of a given individual or small organization is
nearly zero for the benchmarks of interest to Meta”, I think that claim
is true, and it’s important to face it head on. We do need to be
realistic about this fact; if you were to get a paycheck
tomorrow based on your contributions to AI, it would likely be
quite small. Furthermore, the exact methods used to estimate your
individual contributions might feel fickle, and implemented poorly,
could even increase economic
inequality (if most people get 50 cents and a few people get a
windfall).

However, hidden in Zuckerberg’s claim is an assumption about the
organizing power of data creators. If individuals or publishers are able
to band together and coordinate about access to their creative works,
the game is changed. It’s uncontroversial to note that when it comes to
wages for labour, in many fields one’s wages are not purely determined
by individual merit, but rather are directly related to access to
collective bargaining. The same thing is true for emerging “AI content
deals”.

So perhaps a more explicit version of the above quote might be: "the
individual work of most creators isn’t valuable enough for it to matter,
if we assume these creators are never able to coordinate for the
purposes of bargaining". Consider the extreme in which everybody demands
a stop to training; in this world, the production of AI models would
essentially grind to a halt (I should clarify my stance: I don’t think
this would be a good thing, and I think Meta and others’ AI models have
societal benefits; but we should recognize this potential leverage).

So, it’s true that many people may be overestimating the value of
their individual work in a world in which they need to bargain on their
own, but they may actually be underestimating their bargaining power
with sufficient coordination.

Maybe Mark’s implicit “there’s no way you could organize well enough
to threaten our current model” is true; after all, don’t we have many
reasons to be broadly pessimistic about how humans address social
dilemmas? While I think there’s a lot of hard work to be done to make
collective bargaining around data viable and mainstream, I also think it
is viable. A key factor to consider is in many ways, online collective
action can be easier than offline equivalents; I could potentially just
“click join” to become part of a data intermediary
and then the actual questions of data escrow
and sharing can be handled by computing systems.

So, I think Zuckerberg’s point here does stem from some cold hard
facts about how leave-one-out scores and other influence values are
distributed among observations for models trained on very large
datasets. But, there’s a very strong serious chance that an attitude
that dismisses the possibility of effective bargaining by content
creators could backfire, contingent on some combination of regulatory,
grassroots, and within-industry support for entities that engage in data
bargaining.

Zuckerberg also states that when it comes to fair use and licensing,
“I think that all these things are basically going to need to get
relitigated and rediscussed in the AI era.” I absolutely agree on this
front; we’re going to need to consider new models that fall somewhere in
between a complete free-for-all and a complete retreat into walled
fortresses of information.

There’s no doubt that like other companies producing AI models, Meta
is providing a lot of value for the world (in particular, sharing the
Llama model weights is definitely facilitating academic and public
interest research on LLMs) while simultaneously creating the potential
for severe economic impacts and major disruptions to the digital ecology
of online platforms where creation and curation happen. In the long run,
setting up societal frameworks for this kind of bargaining will, I
think, be net beneficial, even if it causes some friction in the short
term.
