# Data Leverage Recap: December 2022 - April 2023

This post will be a short review of the blog so far. There’s two
goals here: to provide a quick catch up for anyone who’s new to the
blog, and to give me a chance to reflect on how these ideas have held up
against a barrage of AI product releases, research outputs, and
news.

### The
Paradox of Reuse, Language Models Edition (Dec 1,
2022)

#### Summary

In this post, I discuss the concern that language model applications
like ChatGPT could erode their own foundations. Platforms like
StackExchange and Wikipedia provide infrastructure and incentives for
users to participate in the creation and sharing of knowledge. These
platforms need traffic and users, which creates a key concern: if
generative AI systems like ChatGPT (which rely on StackExchange and
Wikipedia for training data!) are good enough that users replace their
StackExchange and Wikipedia visits with a ChatGPT conversation, could
GPT-4 hinder our ability to train GPT-5?

#### How the Key Points Hold Up

On March 17th, we got to see some early evidence
for this effect. In the linked Tweet, Dominik Gutt describes a
preliminary results showing a negative effect from Large Language Models
(LLMs) on Q&A activity.

About a week later, a similar point
was made by an authoritative source: Peter Nixey, a top 2% StackOverflow
(SO) contributor, who highlighted the concern that LLMs may prevent
users like him from contributing to SO, and “When it comes time to train
GPTx it risks drinking from a dry riverbed.”

Finally, on April 17th, StackOverflow’s CEO wrote a blog post
discussing generative AI. While the post was controversial in the
community for alluding to integrating generative AI into the platform, I
was excited to see direct references to the importance of SO training
data and the potential tragedy of the commons at play here. “AI is built
on our collective knowledge, and we must all participate in building its
future”.

#### What’s next

The core argument is this piece (and the similar arguments linked
above) rely on making assumptions about how people will use LLMs and
online platforms. It’s certainly possible to imagine scenarios in which
LLMs benefit users and online platforms (a point to which we’ll return
shortly!) For instance, if LLMs primarily address what would be
duplicate questions, reducing the need for humans to flag these
questions and freeing up more time answer interesting questions, this
could be great (though I think it’s unlikely without substantial
effort).

One direction for future work is to use some combination of
agent-based modeling and continued empirical investigation to specify
the conditions necessary for positive sum outcomes. I’ll definitely be
keeping an eye out for more empirical work in this space.

### ChatGPT
is Awesome and Scary: You Deserve Credit for the Good Parts (and Might
Help Fix the Bad Parts) (Dec 4, 2022)

#### Summary

You and most everyone you know probably helped build the new wave of
generative AI technologies like ChatGPT. This post provides an overview
of all the specific details we know about past GPT training data
sources, and how we can use that to engage in some educated guesswork
regarding the data underlying ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bing chat, and more.

#### How the Key Points Hold Up

The public is still mostly in the dark regarding specific ChatGPT
training details. However, the sources highlighted in the original post
still hold up; I think this is pretty close to the best guess we can
make right now.

OpenAI’s stance
on sharing information about training data going forward suggests it may
be hard to do this kind of data documentation in the future. I do think
we can still learn a lot about ChatGPT from studying more transparent
models and datasets like LLaMa
and The Pile — I’d be surprised
if there are massive deviations in pre-training data collection
strategies.

I also came across this great post
from Vicki Boykis provides a similar perspective on the ChatGPT training
data, as well as info about the model architecture and other
details.

#### What’s Next?

I think there’s a lot of value in learning and sharing as much as we
can about the role of data in producing generative AI. Please reach out
if you’re interested in collaborating. This will involve hunting down
datasheets, advocating for the scientific value of sharing datasheets,
and perhaps conducting audits that help us make educated guesses about
data usage (e.g., asking ChatGPT a question it can only answer with
access to a particular source).

### AI
Artist or AI Art Thief? Innovation, Public Mandates, and the Case for
Talking in Terms of Leverage (Dec 15, 2022)

#### Summary:

In this post, I review ongoing discussions about how generative AI
can be seen as “stealing” in a moral or legal sense. The core argument
here: whenever we have a major new innovation, it’s practically
impossible for the broad public to “consent” to contributing to these
technologies, so the technologies cannot come out the of gate with a
public mandate. I also argue that although it may be tough to get
agreement on exactly what it means for ML and AI technologies to steal,
it can be very productive to talk in terms of which groups have leverage
because they can impact model capabilities.

#### How the Key Points Hold Up

Overall, I think the arguments in this post hold up in the face of an
ever-evolving conversation. The original posts states that we were
waiting for a firm legal answer, and as of April 2023 that’s still true.
The implications of any legal decisions here will be huge, so to a
certain extent we do have to keep waiting with bated breath.

I still stand by the value of a leverage-based framing (it’s a pretty
big part of my dissertation), and will keep advocating for this line of
thinking.

#### What’s next

I’m in the process of iterating on a website for crowdsourcing and
highlighting tools that help you use “data levers”. I’d love your help
in improving it!

Another angle for making concrete progress on this issue is through
the development of Responsible AI Licenses for Data. If you’re
interested, consider getting involved in RAIL.

### AI
Technologies are System Maps, and You are a Cartographer (Feb 2,
2023)

### Summary:

Much of my academic work has been at least partially motivated by an
argument for thinking of “data as labor”. Here, I make the case that
this particular “data as X” metaphor can be made even stronger
by comparing data generation to cartographic labor. The comparison with
map-making can be especially useful for thinking about how time might be
on on the side of the data laborer (the world is ever-changing, so over
time data leverage grows).

#### How the Key Points Hold Up

I’ve been reflecting more on this “Data isn’t labor” post
from Sebastien Benthell. It makes some compelling arguments against data
as labor metaphor in the context of search engines and Google. I think
it’s worth discussing the tensions with different data as X
metaphors.

On the technical side, I haven’t seen anything yet that makes me
think that data as cartographic labor is completely lacking in
predictive value, or in instrumental value as a rallying cry for
collective action.

I do think it’s worth making a distinction between the predictive
value of a “data as (cartographic) labor” theory (can we actually
predict how data economies work with a labor lens) and the aspirational
value of this metaphor (we should try to foster a sort of data labor
solidarity to support collective action).

#### What’s next

I believe this remains a ripe conceptual lens for both academic
research in the data governance space, and for public-facing arguments
about data’s value. I plan to continue developing the idea, and have
some work in the oven (stay tuned). The planned datalevers.org FAQ may also help
here.

### Plural
AI Data Alignment (Mar 1, 2023)

#### Summary:

I propose a definition for measuring when an AI system is aligned
with a group of people in terms of data agency:

“An AI system is more aligned with a coalition if members (1) know
how their data contributions flow to that system, (2) can reason about
how changes to data flow might impact AI capabilities, and (3) have
agency to reconfigure these data flows.”

#### How the Key Points Hold Up

I still think this definition has a lot of value to add to ongoing
discussions of AI alignment, building “full-consent” generative AI, and
thinking about AI in terms of how it serves different groups (i.e.,
AI for social good, but social good for whom).

An open question I remain unsure about is whether it’s useful to
frame this as part of “alignment” or something else entirely. There is a
growing movement for full-consent AI, and these ideas are much more
naturally aligned with this movement than any one “AI
Alignment” faction. Let me know what you think about this — is it
important to try and insert this idea into the alignment debate, or
better to avoid the topic of alignment and talk more about consent and
agency?

#### What’s next

I plan to continue developing this definition and trying to find
venues and communities that find it useful. I don’t expect any shocking
new AI releases to cause me to majorly revise it, but that’s always
possible!

### Bing
Rewards for the AI Age (Mar 29, 2023)

#### Summary:

This post describes a proposal for giving people credits for their
data contributions that can be used to query expensive generative AI
systems. A key idea: if we set up a credit system well, we might be able
to simultaneously account for the incentives faced by generative AI
operators, online platforms that host and facilitate the creation of
data, and individual people. A real win-win-win!

#### How the Key Points Hold Up

This post has been shaken a bit by the waves of news. The costs
matter here (even for back-of-the-napkin examples) and we’ve seen big
changes in API costs. We also still don’t know exactly how the
operational costs of generative AI systems are changing, which could
have a big impact on the viability.

Additionally, I started writing this piece after seeing news about
Microsoft limiting Bing conversation lengths to inhibit “bad” behavior.
It seems this may no longer be an issue, either.

On the other hand, discussions
about the environmental impacts of AI are heating up, which may actually
strengthen the case for a credit based system.

It’s very promising to see the StackOverflow CEO making statements
like “If AI models are powerful because they were trained on open source
or publicly available code, we want to craft models that reward the
users who contribute and keep the knowledge base we all rely on open and
growing, ensuring we remain the top destination for knowledge on new
technologies in the future.” I believe this suggests this kind of idea
is quite plausible.

#### What’s Next

The main thing I’ll be on the look out is any generative AI firms
trying something like this out.

I think there’s also room here to use agent-based modeling to
understand the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of system.

If you happen to work on a platform for online communities, and want
to implement something like this, please do let me know!

### Upcoming Topics

As you may have already guessed from this very recap, I’m convinced
one of the most important policy goals for mitigating the negative
impacts of ML and AI is to create standards and transparency around data
opt-in mechanisms, or much better versions of data opt-out (I do think
these can co-exist).

I also think that once we see a slew of new ways for individuals and
groups to engage in data decision-making, via opt-in forms, opt-out
forms, and new licenses, we’re really going to see a need for the AI
field to engage seriously with collective action and governance
research. This won’t just be because it’s the right thing to do, but
because with a paradigm of data agency, gaining a new mandate from the
public will become a core part of building capable AI systems.
