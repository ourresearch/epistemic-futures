One Sentence Summary: Addressing fake news requires a multidisciplinary effort to
understand how the Internet spreads content and how people process news.
Abstract: Fake news emerged as an apparent global problem during the 2016 U.S. Presidential
election. Addressing it requires a multidisciplinary effort to define the nature and extent of the
problem, detect fake news in real time, and mitigate its potentially harmful effects. This will
require a better understanding of how the Internet spreads content, how people process news, and
how the two interact. We review the state of knowledge in these areas and discuss two broad
potential mitigation strategies: better enabling individuals to identify fake news, and intervention
within the platforms to reduce the attention given to fake news. The cooperation of Internet
platforms (especially Facebook, Google, and Twitter) with researchers will be critical to
understanding the scale of the issue and the effectiveness of possible interventions.
Main Text:
The rise of fake news highlights an urgent need for a multidisciplinary scientific effort to study
misinformation in the emergent news ecosystem of the 21st century. Longstanding institutional
bulwarks against misinformation have proven inadequate in the Internet age. Scientific research
should inform the societal challenge of building a new system of safeguards. First, we need to
define the nature and extent of the problem. How prevalent is fake news, and how much
influence does it have on people? What form does that influence take? Second, we need to

1

determine whether we can intervene to reduce the scale and impact of fake news. Can we
empower individuals to detect and ignore it, through fact checking and education? What actions
can platforms take to reduce its flow? Can fake news and social manipulations be algorithmically
detected? How might industry collaborate with academics to identify answers to these questions?
This essay offers preliminary assessments of these foundational questions.
DEFINITION
We define fake news to be fabricated information that mimics the output of the news media in
form, but not in organizational process or intent. Most notably, fake news outlets lack the news
media’s editorial norms and processes for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of information.
Fake news is a subcategory of misinformation—incorrect or misleading information about the
state of the world. It is particularly pernicious in that it undermines the credibility of standard
news outlets. We recognize that some have advocated eschewing the phrase because of its use as
a political weapon. We have retained it both because of its value as a distinct scientific construct,
and because its political salience helps draw attention to an important subject. Below, we offer
some preliminary guideposts for converting this conceptual definition into an operational
research program.
BACKGROUND
The ancien régime protecting against misinformation resulted from the emergence of journalistic
norms of objectivity and balance that arose as a backlash among journalists against the
widespread use of propaganda in World War I—particularly the role journalists had played in
propagating it—as well as against the rise of corporate public relations in the 1920s (for detailed
supporting literature on this and other points, see SM). Local and national oligopolies created by
the dominant technologies of information distribution in the 20th century (publishing and
broadcasting) sustained these norms. The Internet has removed many of those constraints on
dissemination, contributing to the abandonment of traditional news sources that had long enjoyed
high levels of public trust and credibility. For instance, U.S. newspaper circulation fell 30% from
1990 to 2012 (1), while audience ratings for network television evening news programs
plummeted by 56% from 1980 to 2010 (2). In parallel, general trust in the mass media collapsed,
especially on the political right. In 1997, 64% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans reported a
great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. Twenty years later, in 2016, these percentages had
fallen by 13 percentage points (to 51%) among Democrats, and by 27 points (to 14%) among
Republicans (3).
The United States has experienced an important evolution in its geo/socio/political environment
alongside these changes in the news ecosystem. Geographic polarization of partisan preferences
has dramatically increased over the last 40 years (4-5), reducing opportunities for cross-cutting

2

political interaction. Homogenous social networks, in turn, reduce our tolerance for alternative
points of view, amplify attitudinal polarization, boost our likelihood of accepting ideologically
compatible news, and increase closure to new information.
We believe these trends have created a context in which fake news can attract a mass audience.
Below we discuss the social science and computer science research regarding belief in fake news
and the mechanisms by which it spreads. We focus particular attention on the many unanswered
scientific questions raised by the recent proliferation of politically-oriented fake news.
PREVALENCE AND IMPACT
How large a problem is fake news? How common is it, and what impact does it have on
individuals? There are surprisingly few scientific answers to these basic questions; and any
efforts devoted to possible solutions should be commensurate to the magnitude of the societal
problem. In evaluating prevalence of fake news, we advocate focusing on publishers rather than
individual stories, because we view the defining element of fake news to be the intent and
processes of the publisher. This has the additional advantage of avoiding the morass of
evaluating the “fakeness” of every single news story.
One study evaluating the dissemination of a set of prominent fake news stories estimated that the
average American encountered between one and three fake news stories during the month before
the election (6). This likely is a conservative estimate, since the study tracked only 156 fake
news stories. We do know that, as with legitimate news, many fake news stories have gone viral
on social media, suggesting that many people are exposed. However, knowing how many social
media accounts encountered or even shared a piece of fake news is not the same as knowing how
many people read or were affected by it. Metrics such as sharing and liking are subject to the
same manipulations that enable fake news. For instance, the impact of a fake news story that has
been shared by millions of automated accounts but only a few humans is quite different from the
opposite. Despite recent tools to track the spread of fake news, the scientific capacity to measure
human attention to identified fake news content on the Internet is still limited, except in a lab
setting (discussed below).
Importantly, exposure does not equal impact. Evaluation of the medium-to-long-run impact of
exposure to fake news on political behavior (e.g., whether and how to vote) is essentially
nonexistent in the literature. Beyond political impacts, what we know about media effects more
generally suggests many potential pathways of influence, from increasing cynicism and apathy to
encouraging extremism. There is, however, little evaluation of the impact of fake news in these
regards. The scientific community thus needs to develop collective resources for evaluating how
fake (and real) news exposure affects actual people, with known attributes and opinions. There

3

are some proprietary panels aimed at commercial markets devoted to studying people’s attention
on the web; there need to be equivalent resources that are widely available for scientific research.
INTERVENTIONS: EMPOWERING THE INDIVIDUAL, CHANGING THE STRUCTURE
What interventions might be effective at stemming the flow of fake news? We identify two
categories of interventions: (1) those aimed at empowering individuals to evaluate the fake news
they encounter (in particular, fact checking and education); and (2) structural changes aimed at
preventing exposure of individuals to fake news in the first instance (i.e., changes in the policies
of the platforms). For present purposes, we focus on what we know and need to know regarding
the effectiveness of potential interventions.
EMPOWERING INDIVIDUALS
Currently, one of the primary interventions focused on stemming the flow of fake news is fact
checking: the direct identification of content that is factually incorrect. There are many forms of
fact checking, from stand-alone websites that evaluate the factual claims of news reports, such as
Politifact and Snopes, to evaluations of news reports by credible news media, such as the
Washington Post, to warnings on content placed by informational intermediaries, such as
Facebook.
Despite the apparent elegance of fact checking, the science supporting its efficacy as a solution
to fake news is at best mixed. Research shows that people more often use the media for personal
gratification than for truth seeking. Additional research demonstrates that people prefer
information that confirms their pre-existing attitudes (selective exposure) and view information
consistent with their pre-existing beliefs as more persuasive than dissonant information
(confirmation bias). That is, prior partisan and ideological beliefs might prevent acceptance of
fact checking of a given fake news story. Ironically, this means that those most likely to be
deceived by fake news are least likely to believe any attempt to prevent their own deception.
To make matters worse, the way that human memory operates means that unless conducted
carefully, fact checking might even be counterproductive under certain circumstances. Research
on fluency—the ease of information recall—and familiarity bias in politics shows that people
tend to remember information, or how they feel about it, while forgetting the context within
which they encountered it. They are also more likely to accept familiar information as true. Thus,
providing any information may increase an individual’s likelihood of accepting it as true when
encountered again. The literature presents contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of
claim repetition in fact checking. Experimental and survey research has confirmed the basic
familiarity effect, though recent experiments suggest that retractions are more effective in
reducing misinformation effects when they explicitly repeat the misinformation. Further research

4

is needed to reconcile these contradictions and determine the conditions under which fact
checking interventions are most effective.
A second, longer-run, approach seeks to improve individual evaluation of the quality of
information sources through education. There has been a recent proliferation of efforts to inject
training of critical information skills in primary and secondary schools. However, we have found
no research on evaluating the causal impact of general training in critical information
consumption skills on accurate assessments of news source credibility. Moreover, there is an
additional risk that an emphasis on fake news might have the unintended consequence of
reducing the perceived credibility of real news outlets. Given the array of potential approaches,
and the possibility of undermining trust in news generally, there is a great need for a rigorous
program evaluation of different educational interventions.
In summary, the evidence that intervention at the individual level—through either fact checking
or teaching critical skills—will solve the problem of fake news is at best quite limited. This may
reflect broader tendencies in collective cognition, as well as structural changes in our society.
Typically, individuals evaluate the credibility of information they encounter only if it violates
their preconceptions or they are incentivized to do so. Otherwise, they tend to accept information
uncritically. People also tend to align their beliefs with the values of their community.
Geographic polarization along political lines can thus facilitate the emergence of self-reinforcing
alternative realities within a group. Policies of Internet platforms that rank order the delivery of
information according to people’s preferences may amplify the perception of political
homogeneity among one’s peers. This set of issues points to the possibility of Internet platformbased interventions aimed at increasing the quality and diversity of the information that flows
into a community.
PLATFORM-BASED DETECTION AND INTERVENTION: ALGORITHMS AND BOTS
Internet platforms have become the most important enablers and primary conduits of fake news.
It is, for instance, inexpensive to create a website that has the trappings of a professional news
organization. It has also been easy to monetize its content through online ads and social media
dissemination. The Internet not only provides a platform for publishing (mis)information, but is a
networked medium that actively promotes its dissemination.
About 44% of Americans overall report getting news from social media often or sometimes, with
Facebook as by far the dominant source (7). Social media are far more important than
mainstream media as conduits for fake news sites (6). Russia successfully manipulated all of the
major platforms during the 2016 election, as their recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee made clear (8). Is it possible to rewire the Internet to reduce the spread and impact of
fake news? The point of intervention would be the big platform companies, most notably

5

Google, Facebook, and Twitter. They are often the mediators of not only our relationship with
the news media, but also with our friends and relatives. Generally, their business model relies on
monetizing attention through advertising. They use complex statistical models to predict and
maximize engagement with content. For example, most Facebook users do not see all of the
content produced by their Facebook friends, but just the content with which Facebook predicts
they are likely to engage.
It is quite plausible that the emphasis by search and social media platforms on optimizing
attention from consumers increases selective exposure. Google or Facebook may provide users
with slanted content because they predict that someone like them is more likely to engage with it.
There is an emerging literature on the algorithmic underpinnings of the 21st century world,
including some evidence of this amplification of selective exposure of political content for
Facebook and Google. However, even though this research is fairly recent, it represents rapidly
fading snapshots of a moment in history. There exists little research focused specifically on fake
news and no comprehensive data collection system to provide a dynamic understanding of how
these pervasive systems are evolving. It is impossible to recreate the Google of 2010; Google
itself would be unable to do this even if they had a record of the underlying code, because the
patterns emerge from a complex interaction amongst code, content, and users. However, it is
possible to thoroughly capture for posterity what the Google of 2017 is doing. More generally,
researchers need to conduct a rigorous ongoing audit of how the major platforms filter
information.
There is ample evidence that platforms are highly vulnerable to manipulation. By liking, sharing,
and searching for information, social bots (automated accounts impersonating humans) and
extreme partisans can amplify the reach of fake news. Bots are numerous and commoditized.
They were responsible for a significant portion of political content posted during the 2016
campaign, and some of the same bots later attempted to influence the 2017 French election (9).
These tactics also aim to manipulate the algorithms that platforms utilize to predict potential
engagement with content by a wider population. Indeed, a recent Facebook white paper reports
widespread efforts to carry out this sort of manipulation during the 2016 election (10).
The discussion above suggests various possible interventions by platforms. Consumers could be
provided signals of source quality. Source quality could be incorporated into the algorithmic
rankings of content, and personalization of political information could be minimized relative to
other types of content. Functions that emphasize currently trending content could seek to exclude
bot activity from measures of what is trending. More generally, the automated spread of news
content by bots and cyborgs (humans aided by automated posting to their accounts) could be
curbed.

6

The platforms have surely attempted each of these steps, in some form, and many others. They
have posted statements about their efforts, as well as reports, such as Facebook’s aforementioned
white paper on information operations that claimed that manipulations by malicious actors
accounted for less than one tenth of 1% of civic content shared on the platform. However, these
and other such claims are unverifiable. Indeed, researchers, politicians, and the public should
dismiss as self-serving any claims that the platforms make regarding addressing the problem of
misinformation that cannot be verified by third parties.
This points to the value for platforms of collaborating with academics on evaluations of the
scope of the issue and the effectiveness of their interventions There are multiple challenges to
scientific collaboration, both from the perspective of industry and academics; however, these
barriers have been tackled in other contexts. We thus believe these issues are surmountable, and
that there is an ethical responsibility for the platforms to collaborate on the science of fake news.
The possible effectiveness of platform-based policies suggests either self-regulation by the
platforms or government intervention. Direct government regulation of an area as sensitive as
news carries its own risks, such as, for instance, whether or not government regulators could
maintain (and, as important, be seen as maintaining) impartiality in enforcing any content-based
distinctions. An alternative to direct government regulation would be to enable tort lawsuits
alleging, for example, defamation. To the extent an online platform assisted in the spreading of a
manifestly false (but still persuasive) story, there might be avenues for liability, which in turn
would pressure platforms to intervene more regularly. In the U.S. context, however, a provision
of the 1996 Communications Decency Act offers near-comprehensive immunity on this front to
platforms for false or otherwise-actionable statements penned by others. Any change to this legal
regime, however, itself raises thorny issues about the extent to which platform content (and
content curation) should be subject to second-guessing by people alleging injury.
Structural interventions generally raise legitimate concerns about respecting human agency. But
just as the media oligopolies of the 20th century shaped the information to which Americans were
exposed, the far-more-vast Internet oligopolies are already shaping human experience on a
global scale. The question before us is how those immense powers are being—and should be—
exercised.
CONCLUSION
Current hand-wringing over fake news in many ways mirrors widespread concern in the mid20th century that propaganda—by Nazis, and later by Communists—posed a fundamental threat
to democracy. These concerns prompted the post-World War II generation of sociologists,
psychologists, and political scientists to pioneer the social-psychological school of political
behavior research. Ironically, these scholars found little evidence of such a threat. Yet

7

subsequent generations of scholars, building on these foundational works, have found that even
if the media (the presumed purveyors of propaganda) typically cannot change what we think
(that is, our attitudes), they are far more successful at changing what we think about (via
priming, framing, and agenda setting). The analogy to fake news is clear: even if fake news does
not alter most people’s beliefs, it may nonetheless reinforce existing false beliefs, increase their
salience, or shape the news agenda, with potentially harmful effects for society. Explicating and
countering such effects requires a multidisciplinary research program similar to the post-World
War II scholarly effort aimed at countering propaganda effects.
Our call here is to promote interdisciplinary research spanning psychology, computer science,
political science, economics, law, and communication with the normative objective of reducing
the spread of fake news and of addressing the underlying pathologies it has revealed. The
failures of the news in the early 20th century led to the rise of a set of journalistic norms and
practices that, while imperfect, generally served us well by striving to provide objective, credible
information. We must again redesign our news ecosystem in the 21st century. Doing so will
require new, multidisciplinary science on fake news and misinformation.
