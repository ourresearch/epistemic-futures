# Content Telemetry — v1 core and profile scope

## Full text

# Content Telemetry: scope for core, profiles and governing terms

Content Telemetry core defines a small event vocabulary and the records needed to exchange those events. An implementation must be able to emit, receive and validate core telemetry without selecting a profile or using an external registry, resolver or verification service.

A profile adds shared semantics or processing rules that independent implementations need to interpret in the same way. Profiles depend on a pinned core version and cannot redefine core events. A deployment may select a small profile bundle in its endpoint, SDK, manifest or relationship configuration. That bundle is resolved once at build, startup or configuration time. It is not negotiated per event, turn or assertion, and conflicts are configuration errors.

Core keeps a small reserved event vocabulary. Profiles that need relationship-specific events define a controlled, namespaced schema extension; they do not add those events to the core vocabulary. A consumer that implements only the core schema is not required to accept extension events.

`content_cited` records an explicit source association in an output artifact. `content_presented` records that content or a reference was made perceivable on a recipient-facing surface. Either may occur without the other, and neither proves human attention.

External services may resolve identifiers, retrieve evidence, verify signatures, apply trust policy or report derived aggregates. Those services can support a deployment, but they are not required for core conformance. Governing terms decide which events, fields, privacy level, delivery destination, cadence and reports a relationship requires. They also decide commercial meaning. Telemetry does not determine ownership, permission, price or compensation.

Conformance and verification answer five separate questions:

1. **Syntactic validity:** does the record satisfy the schema and deterministic local rules?
2. **Cryptographic validity:** do its digests, signatures or timestamps verify?
3. **Trust-policy acceptance:** does this consumer accept the issuer, verifier, method and evidence?
4. **Factual truth and completeness:** did the event happen as claimed, and were all qualifying events reported?
5. **Entitlement:** was the reported use permitted under an applicable grant or agreement?

Events are claims by identified emitters. Evidence applies to a particular assertion. Origin or access evidence can corroborate only what that observer could see; it cannot prove grounding, reproduction, citation, presentation, engagement, truth, completeness or entitlement.

Relationship configuration should avoid profile proliferation. A publisher may require `content_grounded` and `content_cited` events, intent-level topics, event delivery to a named endpoint and a set of aggregate reports. Another may require `content_cited`, `content_presented` and `content_engaged` events with a different privacy level. These are deployment choices backed by governing terms, not publisher-specific protocol profiles. A new profile is justified only when a class of relationships introduces semantics or processing rules that multiple implementations must interpret in the same way.

An implementation uses the core schema and specification, a small profile bundle where needed, and the governing terms. It resolves the bundle into one deployment configuration at build, startup or relationship setup, not per event or turn. Core alone remains a complete path.

For example, an operator could choose a SPUR advertising deployment recipe and supply the publisher endpoints and commercial requirements. The SDK or collector would resolve the required delivery, advertising and evidence capabilities at startup. The agent would then emit ordinary lifecycle events; the collector would route publisher reports and send relevant evidence to the configured verification service. The developer would not select profiles or negotiate capabilities inside each agent turn.

The closed consultation feeds a v1 release candidate rather than an intermediate v0.2 release. Compatibility with a mistake in the preview version is not a constraint. A breaking change is acceptable when it makes v1 easier to implement. It must include migration notes and replacement fixtures, and must not silently change meaning within an existing version.
